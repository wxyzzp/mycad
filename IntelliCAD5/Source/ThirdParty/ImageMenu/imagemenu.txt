USING IMAGEMENU
===============

Imagemenu is an SDS add-on that performs the functionality of the ***IMAGE section of an IntelliCAD menu file.


TO USE IMAGEMENU:

1. Save the files Imagemenu.dll and Image.dcl in a directory that is in an IntelliCAD search path (menu search path). (Type OPTIONS on the command line to view, add, or remove search paths.)

2. Use the "imagemenu" function to open the IMAGE window. In the menu file, replace

   $I=IMAGEMENUSECTION $I=*

   with

   (imagemenu "menufile" "starting image section")

where menufile is the name of the file and starting image section is the name of the section you want to define as the first section.

Imagemenu reads and performs the commands in the menu file, including jumps to new IMAGE sections.  

NOTE: Icon (slide) images do not highlight when you select them.  This is a known issue at this time. However, you can double-click an image to perform its associated action.  Menu  should not contain blank empty lines between menu items.

Version 1.012
Search for ***IMAGE is now case insensitive
If slide description is missing, the slide name is provided in the list
  [somelib(slide,slide description)] - with description
  [somelib(slide)] - without description
Added several error message to help with implementation


Version 2.011
Adjusted source to compile on IntelliCAD 2000:
Note: the 'color = graphics_background' attribute is currently broken in DCL. As a workaround I coded a fixed color in the DCL file. You may want to change this depending on the backgroundcolor.

To change this background color on the tiles change the
color = 0;
lines to
color = 7;
(0 = black, 7 = white).
