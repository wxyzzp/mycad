Currently the library is just a dll exporting classes without real functionality.
The main its aim now is introducing its future functionality for using in other
parts of code.
So, here is the TODO list:
- add data members to classes,
- make some methods in base classes virtual,
- add overriding(virtual) methods to child classes,
- implement methods,
- see also notes about arrays below.
After that these notes can be erased, but the following ones should exist
and be complemented if necessary.


Changes from AcGe to Ge
===========================================================================
The Ge library hasn't internal implementing classes like AcGeImpEntity3d.
Instead whole the functionality of exported classes is implemented in
themselves and therefore they have additional data members.


Some declarations/definitions/functionality which are existing in AcGe
are not included in the Ge library:
- some non-public class members (they are included and commented out
  with "original code:" tag);
- some members of the AcGeContext struct (which has become CGeContext);
- abbreviations like as in the gegblabb.h file;
- the AcGeGetMetaTypeIndex template function with its specializations
  (gegetmti.h etc. files) and overloads to the new operator from
  the gegblnew.h file;
- casting macros from the geassign.h file
- I/O classes from gefiler.h, gefileio.h, gedxfio.h and gedwgio.h files


Analogs for AcGe's arrays are now implemented as std::vectors so it causes
compiler warning C4251 about their dll interface. It's have to check if
they are really exported with such implementation.


Some identificators are changed:
- classnames which are changed not only by replacing of "Ac" with "C":
 AcGeTol -> CGeTolerance;
 AcGeLinearEnt2d -> CGeLinearCurve2d;
 AcGeLinearEnt3d -> CGeLinearCurve3d;
 AcGePlanarEnt -> CGePlanarSurface;
 AcGeLineSeg2d -> CGeLineSegment2d;
 AcGeLineSeg3d -> CGeLineSegment3d;
 AcGeSplineEnt2d -> CGeSplineCurve2d;
 AcGeSplineEnt3d -> CGeSplineCurve3d;
 AcGePointEnt2d -> CGePointEntity2d;
 AcGePointEnt3d -> CGePointEntity3d;
 AcGeSurfSurfInt -> CGeSurfaceSurfaceInt;
- changes for satisfying our coding rules
 (prefixes for enums, static, boolean, pointing vars)


Adesk::Boolean is replaced with bool and kTrue/kFalse with true/false.
