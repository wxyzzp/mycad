Change Description:
Finalized round tripping dimassoc. AutoCAD's 2004 associative
dimensions now round trip correctly.

Note there is a bug in AutoCAD that exhibits strange behavior when one of
the associated entities is an xref intersected with another entity. 
This strange behavior is still present and the same when we round trip a dimension.

Notes to Developers:

Notes to QA:
AutoCAD BUG reproduction steps:

Draw a line, and save it.
Open a new drawing and xref in the first.
Draw another line that crosses the line in the xref'd drawing.
Draw another line somewhere away from the first two.
Now create an associated dimension using the intersection of first drawn line and the xref,
and the end of the second drawn line.
AutoCAD bug. You would expect if you move the intersecting line or the xref, that AutoCAD
would maintain the dimension from the intersection of the line and xref, but it fails. 
grip editing either the xref or the line that intersects it has unpredictable results.
