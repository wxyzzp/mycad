Description:	Enhancements to Roundtrip application to test dwg and dxf operations between Icad and Acad.
Comments:	The roundtrip_dwg_dxf application allows users to perform roundtrip testing of Icad and Acad and
		to use dwg or dxf as the input for any step. The base applciation does a dxfin or open on the input
		(depending on whether the previous step did a dxfout or save) followed by a dxfout or saveas (depending
		on what the user chose). The output of one step in the input for the next step and upto five steps
		can be specified. FOr each step, Icad or Acad can be chosen and different versions of the executables can be
		chosen for each step.

		The application has been enhanced with the following changes :-

		1. User can now specify additional commands to run in each step. For example, "zoom e " can be  typed into
		the textbox for additional script commands and the application will add this command for each file it processes.
		More than one command can be given as input (eg) 
		zoom
		e
		erase
		all

		undo
		
		These commands will be run for all scripts.

		2. User can specify the max. time a script can take to run. If a script hangs due to invalid command, it will be
		automatically terminated after this interval has passed.
		3. Better reporting of results and errors.
