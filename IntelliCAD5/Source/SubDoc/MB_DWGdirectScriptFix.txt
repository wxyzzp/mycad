Change Description:
This fixes three regress script failures;
Source\Regress\scripts\68870.scr
Source\Regress\scripts\78243.scr
Source\Regress\scripts\78417.scr

All three now run to completion.

68870.scr and 78417.scr were because of a difference in running it 
under DWGdirect and not running it under DWGdirect.
78243.scr was because of accessing a NULL pointer. I added code to 
avoid this in ucsicon.cpp.
