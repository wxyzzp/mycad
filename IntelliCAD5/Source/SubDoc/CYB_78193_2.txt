		When we fixed this bug last time we had commented the following statement.
		
		SetWindowText(hWnd,rb.resval.rstring);
		
		beacuse it was updating wrong window.
		But this led to a minor problem. When we tried to remove the overrides of the 				dimension style the edit windows of DIMPOST and DIMAPOST were not cleared.
		To solve this new problem we have now allowed to settext to window if its 				setting it "". SO now the new code  is 
	
		if ( strlen(rb.resval.rstring) == 0 )
			SetWindowText(hWnd,rb.resval.rstring);

		This was the minor problem because it just did'nt clear the edit boxes. The 				database was fine.
