Description:	This submission adds a regress suite to IntelliCAD.
Comments:	This is the initial version of a regress suite for IntelliCAD. The regress suite consists of
		scr files which are run from a batch file (regress.bat). Base dxf files are provided and each
		scr file is expected to write out a dxf file to comapre with the base file. The output from
		regress is written to regress.log file.

		The Readme.txt file shows what environment variable to set and how to add new tests to the regress suite.
		Currently 3 scr files have been added and more will be added shortly.

		Currently the regress suite will report errors for each of the script files. This is due to the fact 
		the dxf values for $TDCREATE, $TDUPDATE, $TDINDWG and $TDUSRTIMER vary for each run of ICAD. A fix 
		will be made for this shortly.
