	*	CvsHist:Source/Source/prj/ICAD/IcadExplorer.cpp
		Added case for dimstyle for "BOOL IEXP_Newdlg::OnInitDialog() " so that existing                 dimstyle get filled up on clicking of change button.
		If the delete dialog is already exist (already created ) then display it instead 		of returning it.
