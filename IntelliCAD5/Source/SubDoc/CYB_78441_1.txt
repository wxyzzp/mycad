		The problem was in case of defuning functions with name starting with "_". Actaully, internal commands are starting with "_" eg _LINE. So in IntelliCAD when user tries to defun _LINE again ( _LINE is already in atom list ) , we append "L:" at the begining to differentiate the basic _LINE command with the newly defined LISP LINE function. So while undefuning _LINE we append "L:" at the begining and then undefun it. The basic _LINE is intact.

But when the function name start with "_" and is not the internal commands, we add it to the atom list as it is.(  without "L:" ) but when undefunning it we append "L:" and try to find it in atom list which naturally would fail.

So this becomes a special case, the function name start with "_" but still is not the internal IntelliCAD command. I have have checked the link2mod->id == -2 to differentiate the two cases.

Please note, I think we should have "_" strictly reserved for internal commands only. IntelliCAD have little different behaviour when comapred to autocad. If we define "_LINE" we can access the new function like "L:_LINE".
