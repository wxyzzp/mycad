Description:	This submission adds the source for regress_icad_acad_roundtrip application.
Comments:	There are two regress applications. The second regress application performs a roundtrip between
		ICAD and ACAD. Here we open a dwg file in ICAD, save it as dwg, open the dwg file in ACAD, save it
		as dwg and reopen the file saved by ACAD in ICAD. The roundtrip is currently tested against ACAD R14 
		and to get it run against ACAD 2000/2002 would require slight change to the source. This change is the 
		prompt which ACAD uses in the save command. This is done by creating scr files on the fly to open the dwg file
		save in the formats shown below and quit and running the scripts.

		Usage is 

		regress_icad_acad_roundtrip "Directory_to_process" "Output_Directory"

		The roundtrip executable process all dwg files in the "Directory_to_process". It recurses to find all
		dwg files in the hierarchy and processes them. It writes the output files in the same directory structure
		under "Output_Directory". 

		It is IMPORTANT that "Output_Directory" be not present under "Directory_to_process". If it is, the processing
		will never end.

		The regress_icad_acad_roundtrip executable saves multiple dwg files and dxf files with the same prefix as the dwg
		file it is processing. For each directory under "Directory_to_process" it processes, it creates 12 directories

		For the first ICAD operation on a dwg file, it will save dwg files in 3 formats and a dxf file.

		output_2k, output_LT95 and output_R14 have the dwg file saved in 2K, LT95 and R14 formats.
		output_dxf has the dxf file.

		If we are testing roundtrip against R14, then ACAD will open the saved file in output_R14 directory. It will
		in turn write 2 dwg files and 1 dxf file.

		output_acad_LT95 and output_acad_R14 have the dwg file saved in LT95 and R14 formats.
		output_acad_dxf has the dxf file.

		If we were doing a roundtrip against ACAD 2K, then a dwg file will be written to output_acad_2k directory.

		Finally ICAD will open the dwg file saved by ACAD R14 in the output_R14 directory and save 3 dwg and 1 dxf
		file.
		
		output_round_2k, output_round_LT95 and output_round_R14 have the dwg file saved in 2K, LT95 and R14 formats.
		output_round_dxf has the dxf file.

		This structure opens up the possibilities for stress testing roundtrip which is not coded yet. We could make 
		ICAD open the files written by ACAD in LT95 format or have ACAD open the LT95 format and have the second run of
		ICAD open the 2K version. We could also do dxfin on the various formats.


		Required system variables :-

		ICAD_REGRESS_EXE_PATH -- This has the complete path (including icad.exe) to the icad executable.
		ACAD_REGRESS_EXE_PATH -- This has the complete path (including acad.exe) to the acad executable.
		ACAD_REGRESS_VER -- This tells the applciation wheich version of the saved dwg file ACAD will open.
				    This is also used by the second run of ICAD.
		The following are optional --
		TT_EXE -- True Time executable
		ICAD_TT_REGRESS_EXE_PATH -- ICAD executable instrumented with TrueTime.
		BC_EXE -- Boundschecker executable.
		TC_EXE -- Truecoverage executable.
		ICAD_COV_REGRESS_EXE_PATH -- ICAD executable instrumented with TrueCoverage.
		PURIFY_EXE -- Purify executable.
		ICAD_PURIFY_EXE -- Icad executable instrumented by Purify.

		Output file :-

		c:/icadregress.log
