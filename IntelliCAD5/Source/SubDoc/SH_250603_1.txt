Description:	This submission fixes the bug #78538 - "Chamfer of polyline does not work 
                even if one vertex is short". The problem is in cmd_fillet_or_chamfer_lwpline(), 
                which doesn't replace the existing polyline with the new polyline after chamfered 
                if one of the segments of the polyline is too short to be chamfered. This problem 
                is fixed by removing that condition check so the old polyline in the database is 
                always replaced with new one.
