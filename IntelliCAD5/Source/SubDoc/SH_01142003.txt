Description:    Fixed bug #78427 - "isometric viewpoint prints topview, and 
                ends up as another view", which was introduced by one of the
                later changes that overrided my previous change to fix this
                problem. The bug was in CIcadView::FilePrint(), which changed
                ucs to plan view.
