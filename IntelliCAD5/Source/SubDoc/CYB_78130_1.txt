		 After xref - detach of a drwaing the table entries of the corresponding 
		 drawing are deleted ,actually marked for deletion and deleted only when the 
		 drawing is saved (defualt behaviour of sds_entdel). Now when the same drwaing
		 was being xref- attached, findtabrec(last parameter=0) was finding these 
		 deleted table entries during the attach process. IcadExplorer shows only 
		 non-deleted entries hence these entries were not visible.

			Nowe changed calls to findtabrec to find only non-deleted table entries
		this will lead to proper table record entries and will solve problems 
		that could have occured later after a attach-detach-attach kind of drwaing is 
 		saved and opened. Also changed other calls to findtabrec just as a precaution
                so that all pointers point to valid(non-deleted) table records
