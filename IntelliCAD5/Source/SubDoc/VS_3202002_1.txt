Description:	This submission updates regress suite to IntelliCAD.
Comments:	The regress suite has been updated. Instead of a batch file, an executable (regress_scr.exe) is present.
		The regress_scr.exe automatically runs all scr files in the scripts subdirectory.

		The scr files set logfileon and the logfile is written to the log directory. The output dxf file is 
		placed in output_dxf directory and is processed to reset values for $TDCREATE, $TDUPDATE, $TDINDWG and
		$TDUSRTIMER to 0.0. The base dxf files have these values set to 0.0. The output dxf file and base dxf file are 
		compared and differences (if any) are written to the icadregress.log file.

		Another change -- the base files will no longer have a suffix of base in the file name (ie) the base file for 
		arctex_at.scr will not be arctex_at_base.dxf but arctex_at.dxf.
