Change Description:
Because *Model_Space/*Paper_Space and such blocks have associated
layouts with them, I have broken the processing of layouts out of
the general Objects processing so it can be done prior to processing
blocks.

Fixed a problem with attribute location, and negative Z scaling
on block insertions.
