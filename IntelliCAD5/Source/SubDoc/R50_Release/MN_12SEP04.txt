3.  Overview:
      
	  Dave sent a drawing in which "Zoom Extent" is not working properly. This 
bug is not reproducable in "ICAD_Cee" branch. I have looked the code of "ICAD_cee"
branch and I have found that there is a class "CChainIterator" present in "GR"
module in the file "DoDef.h". This class is helpful in calcalating the drawing 
extents. I have added the definition of this class in the file "DeDef.h".
	There is algorithm present in the file "Panzoom.cpp" in "CMD module" of "ICAD_cee"
branch to calculate the drawing extents instead of regenerating the entities 
in "ZOOM/Extents" case. This algorithm significantly reduces calculations. I 
have added this algorithm in "panzoom.cpp" file in the function "cmd_zoom_extents".
	For this algorithm to work properly, I have added "isMultichain" function in 
"gr_displayobject" class present in the file "DoDef.h" in GR module.
I changed the definition of an existing constant viz: "DISP_OBJ_HIGHLIGHTED"
to have the value of 256.
I have also added a new constant integer variable viz: "DISP_OBJ_MULTI_CHAIN"
in this file. This constane now has a value of 32.

8.  Testing Considerations:
The code should be tested for the following steps:
1. Start IntelliCAD 5.
2. Open the drawing sent by Dave.
3. Give "zoom" command.
4. Select "extent" option.
5. The drawing gets properly zoomed.
6. Test for other drawings.    

9.  Installation Issues:
