3. Overview:

This submission fix the following the problem:

The Undo option in TRIM command did not earse the one of ellipses or splines 
after an open ellipse or spline curve was trimmed to become two separated pieces.

When a open curve is trimme and broken down to two separated pieces, one of the 
pieces is a new entity. In cmd_trim_object(), the name of the new entity was not 
passed back to caller so it never be earsed by the code of the UNDO option. This 
bug is fixed.
