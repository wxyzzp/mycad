3.  Overview:
	This submission allows DWGdirect generated error messages to be passed
	along to the user either via a message box or in the history window
	depending on if the EXPERT sysvar is set to 5 or not. This makes for
	more informative error messages, and allows the distinction to be made
	when the error is caused by trying to read an invalid dwg version. I.e.
	prior to version 2.5.
