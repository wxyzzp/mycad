3. Change Overview:

This submission fixes the bug #78822 - "TRIM of circle/circle silently fails 
when cutting edge entity is PLINE".

The original code to trim a arc or circle using a polyline with more than one 
segment crossing the arc or circle is not implemented correctly. This is problem
is fixed by replacing the code with new implementation that I introduced a few 
weeks ago.
