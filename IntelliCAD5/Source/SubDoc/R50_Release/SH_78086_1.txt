3. Overview:

This submission fixes the bug #78086 - "Cone and Ellipse commands do not accepts 3-d 
points at some prompts". The problems were SDS_AskForPoint() could not accept 3D point
as input in dragging mode. The problem is fixed by temporarily setting the value of 
global variable SDS_GetZScale to TRUE before SDS_dragobject() is called in 
cmd_cone_mesh(), cmd_cone_solid_elp(), and cmd_ellipse().
