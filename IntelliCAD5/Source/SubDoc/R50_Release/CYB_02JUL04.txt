3.  Overview:

Mohan:
	In "OnCreate()" member function of "CLWeightComboBox" class in the file
"LWeightComboBox.cpp" file, new font object is created and for this creation,
memory is allocated using pointer "*pFont" of "CFont" type. I have freed the 
memory associated with this pointer after its use to solve the 
memory leak problem.


Sachin:
	I have added 2 Bmps for different Splash Screens. They are as follows:
		1. "icadsplash_Standard.bmp" for Standard Version.
		2. "icadsplash_Professional.bmp" for Professional Version.
	At present I have just modified the original BMP created by the artisti
and written the words Professional and Standard on them. In later stages
we might see these BMPS modified to have the artistic touch. 
	The corresponding code has also been modified in the file: 
"Eng-us/AuthenticateRes.rc".
