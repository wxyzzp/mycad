3.  Overview:

	An earlier implementation of "lineweight" and "lweight" command involved
a Lineweight dialog that was shown when the command was executed. From this 
Dialog, the Lineweight settings could be modified such as "Default Lineweight",
"Current Lineweight", "Display Scale" etc. I had done this implementation and it 
was accepted as it was according to the then latest specification for 
IntelliCAD 5.0.
	When Dave had looked at the BricsCAD code, he saw that the Lineweight settings
were present in the Drawing Settings Dialog under the Display Tab with a seperate 
section for Lineweights through the combo-box. Dave liked the idea and copied all 
the stuff from the Lineweight Dialog under a seperate section for the Display tab.
	However Dave also wanted to modify the behaviour of "lweight" command. He wanted 
to invoke the Drawing Settings dialog with Lineweight settings rather than the 
original Lineweight dialog, when the command "lweight" was executed.
	This is what I have provided, I have changed the route to invoke this Drawing 
Settings dialog with the Lineweight section rather than the Lineweight Dialog present
earlier. I have also removed the existence of this dialog from the RC files and 
the files that included the code for the dialog and the file where it was invoked from. 
The three files that I have deleted are given in the Change Log below.
	Thus the new behaviour is reflected in 3 places:
		1. Implementation of "lweight" command.
		2. Implementation of "lineweight" command.
		3. Right-Click the "LWT" button and Choose "Settings" from the pop-up menu that
			comes up.

8.  Testing Considerations:

The code should be checked for the following cases:
1. Invoke "lweight" command. The "Drawing Settings" dialog with "Display" Tab 
	containing "Lineweight" section is shown instead of the earlier 
	Lineweight Dialog.
2. Invoke "lineweight" command. The "Drawing Settings" dialog with "Display" Tab 
	containing "Lineweight" section is shown instead of the earlier 
	Lineweight Dialog.
3. Right-Click the "LWT" button and Choose "Settings" from the pop-up menu that
	comes up. The "Drawing Settings" dialog with "Display" Tab 
	containing "Lineweight" section is shown instead of the earlier 
	Lineweight Dialog.
