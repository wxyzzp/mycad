1 Process Checklist :

* Regress run without new failures: Y
* Did you test it? : Y
* Code Reviewed By: 
* Docs Changes Required: N
* Submitted to branch(es): R40_Dev, R50_Release

2. Modules Affected : GEO, ICADLIB

3. Overview:

This submission makes following changes to the low level geometry 
utility classes in GEO module in order to implement the projection 
options for TRIM and EXTEND commands and VISIBALE osnap:

* Adds CSurface and CPlane classes for constructing planar geometry.
* Adds ProjectTo() to CCurve, CLine, CRay, CUnboundedLine, CEllipArc, 
  CPolyLine, CNURBS/CControlPoints classes to project those curves 
  along an arbitrary direction onto an arbitrarily oriented plane.
* Adds ProjIntersect() functions to CCurvePair class to compute the 
  intersection of curves in an arbitrary direction.

This submission also fixes the problems in AsGeoEllipse() and 
AsGeoEllipArc() in which the normal of ellipse entities were not 
taken account when they convert db_circle and db_arc entities to 
the CEllipse and CEllipArc entities.

                curves along an arbitrary direction to an an arbitrarily 
                oriented plane.

8.  Testing Considerations:
* Unit Test Description: Tested by using test programs.
* Notes for QA Testing: QAs can not test those new functions until the projection
                        of TRIM and EXTEND commands are implemented.
