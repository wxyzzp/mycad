Change Overview:
Added export for Spatial filters.

Added code to allow recovery of .DWF files.

Commented out a few more scripts from regress.lst that put up alert dialogs,
stopped for user import and highly redundant - like the ezoom series.

Reworked some XREF code based on ODA changes. There are still at least
three functions that are being added by ODT that I'll need to make use of
once they come on line.

Updated some ODA utilities

Notes to QA:
Dan, you should get familiar with odreadex.exe odamfcapp.exe and singledoc.exe.
they have been invaluable to me in implementing the DWGdirect throat.
