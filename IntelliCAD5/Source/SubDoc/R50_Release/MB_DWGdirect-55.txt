Change Overview:
Added support for svg export.  *1 
Added iDrop interface code supplied from an ITC member. *2 

Made some minor changes to the code to prevent Purify from complaining.
Also commented out some OLD Visio code that was still doing a LoadLibrary on the 
Visio DWG display ActiveX control.

Notes to Developers:

Notes to QA:
*1	Currently the entire drawing is being exported. I am researching a problem
    that causes the drawing to shift radically if I try to only export a selection
	set as the other export formats (.bmp, .wmf, .emf) do. I will be making this behave
	like the rest soon.
	Currently there is a DWGdirect bug (that has already been fixed) that prevents 
	files with polylines in them from exporting. The next ODT code drop should fix this.
	In addition, dimensions seem to be missing from the svg file too. I have notified ODT
	of this.

*2	I have added the code supplied by stabiplan.nl which is for supporting AutoCAD's iDrop
	interface. It appears to be doing all the right things, but I have not been able to 
	successfully test it. The file that gets downloaded is in fact a .html file that says
	something to the affect that the file or site could not be opened.
	I have noticed (in the debuger) that the output file name has a couple of tildes in the
	file path. Which may be part of the problem.
	However, I believe it to be a permissions issue on my machine. For that reason, I have
	left in the code even though I have not been able to test it. It is easy to remove if
	we decide to. Note that it is NOT a valid test to say that AutoCAD works, but IntelliCAD
	doesn't - because AutoCAD doesn't actually download the .dwg file the way the IntelliCAD
	code does. I'm researching, and would appreciate QA testing it too.
