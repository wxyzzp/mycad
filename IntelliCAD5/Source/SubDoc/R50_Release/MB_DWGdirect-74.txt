3.  Overview:
Minor change to some member variable names.
Also to some member function names to be consistant.

Added code to read Layer Indexes (currently not called)
Added code to write Layer Indexes (currently not called)
Added code to read idbuffers (currently not called)
Added code to write idbuffers (currently not called)

Fixed a visibility bug on export. Group 60 was not being exported.

Fixed a leak in conversion of an ODDBResbuf to an sds_resbuf. Essentialy
I had to add a marker link in sds_resbuf lists that contain ODDB data. It
was to fix the problem where ObjectID's are converted to Handles and back.
This fix allow these sds_resbuf chains to be deleted via sds_relrb().

Added code to actually use the WasLoadedFromA2K flag on import.
Changed the way delayed entities are processed to allow more granular
handling by allowing the list of entities to be passed into the call to
process them.

Update to OdDbOle2FramePtr Processing based on ODT changes.
Added DD_VC6MD_Ole.lib to the list of libs to link with too.

Fixed qsave & autosave so they no longer change the drawing version when
they are executed. They get the current version of the in-memory drawing
and pass that through to do the save. 
NOTE that if you do a save or saveas you get the file open dialog, and 
if you simply hit save, you may change the version because of what is 
current in the 'save type' drop down.

Changed the verbiage on the notorious;
Pre-R14 & Pre-2K alert boxes to the following for clarity.
Pre-R14 file formats do not support some entities.\nThese entities will not be saved in the drawing.\nContinue?"
Pre-2K file formats do not support some entities.\nThese entities will not be saved in the drawing.\nContinue?"

Also fixed the problem with R12 hatch breaking the round trip testing.
