2. Modules Affected : 
   
   Source/Prj/lib/cmds/cmds4.cpp:     Replaced HIT_TOLERANCE in cmd_trim_object() and 
                                      cmd_extend_object() with a HitTolerance and added
                                      CmdGetHitTolerance() to set the value of HitTolerance
                                      based on the size of the crossing box in UCS.
   
3. Overview:

Trim/Extend commands do not work for large drawing views when projmode == 1 or 2. The reason
is that a constant tolerance value is used for performing ray-hit test to select the trimmed 
entities, which is fine for small drawings but is too tight for the large drawing view so that
the trimmed entities are not found in those cases. Using the fixed value as ray-hit test 
tolerance is not appropriate because the project ratio between screen coordinate system 
and UCS is varied with the drawing view size so the same distance between pick point and 
a candidate entity on the screen can be very different in UCS for the different sizes of 
drawing view. This submission fix the problem by changing t static toelrance value to a 
dynamic value.
