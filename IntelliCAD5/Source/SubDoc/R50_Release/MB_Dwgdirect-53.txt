Change Overview:
Some layout data wasn't being read/written correctly. I have
re-written a small portion of the code to do that.

Stephen found that I was not projecting arc and circle center
points correctly on export. I added transfrom calls to correct
the problem.

Notes to Developers:

Notes to QA:
Note there are still outstanding issues with deleteing/renaming
layouts, and having them preserved correctly upon subsequen read/writes.
For example if you delete layout2 (in a default drawing) save and re-open
it, layout2 is back. This is related to opening a blank drawing in DWGdirect.
It defaults to ALWAYS having model/layout1/layout2 layouts by default. I
am investigating the best way to handle these issues.
