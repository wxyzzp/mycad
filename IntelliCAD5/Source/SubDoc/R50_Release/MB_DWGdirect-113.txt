3.  Overview:
	This submission special cases a class of drawings that are having their
	block names and/or their handles changed by adding them to the output 
	database. This was causing problems when those block ids were being looked
	up to put into instances of these blocks. 

	Note that this fix is not perfect. THere are still situations where a blocks
	id cannot be resolved, in that case, there is no instance of that block created.
	For example given a block name/handle pair like *X1 - 33, that becomes *X2 - 4F,
	is in essence lost in the database. When I try to instantiate an instance of *X1,
	the db_insert tells me its name is *X1. However, there may not even be a *X1 in the
	database, so now if I look it up by handle, I could get the wrong block, because
	the handle has been changed too. 

	At this point in our ship cycle, I believe I have enough redundant checks to handle
	this situation as well as it can be. THere may be drawings that will not have some
	blocks instantiated. These are mostly R12 hatches that have this problem. Dimensions
	seem to be OK.
