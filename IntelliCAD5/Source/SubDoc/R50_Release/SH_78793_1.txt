3. Overview:

This submission fixes the bug #78793 - "Crash when attempting EXTRUDE on some 
closed SPLINE entities".

The root of the cause was in the spline extraction function that tried to access
the fit point that has been purged after the control points of the spline had 
been moved by using grip point editing. This problem is fixed by changing the 
function to access NURBS data.
