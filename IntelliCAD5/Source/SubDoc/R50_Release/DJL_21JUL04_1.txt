1. Process Checklist :
* Regress run without new failures: N
* Did you test it? : Y
* Code Reviewed By: Yamuna
* Docs Changes Required: N
* Submitted to branch(es):
R50_Release and R40_Dev

2. Modules Affected :
None

3.  Overview:
I have been having about 20-30 script failures whenever I run regression.  Many of the failures are due to script problems
with selecting entities.  I have increased the accuracy of the selections or changed the pickbox to 4 for many scripts.
See section below for the list of files and an overview of each change.

4.  Notes to Docs:
None

5.  Notes for Regress/Benchmarks:

Script Change required: Y
77892.scr - Added Pickbox 4.

78167_1.scr - Changed a couple of picked points to select objects to make them more accurate.

78300_a.scr - Added CMDECHO 0.

78343.scr - Added CMDECHO 0.

78393_T1fts011.scr - I really don't know how this was working for ANYONE.  The script set EXPERT to 5 but then still had "Y"
added for "Yes to overwrite existing" during the Wblock.

78418.scr - Added CMDECHO 0.

arc.scr - Added Pickbox 4.

attdisp_options.scr - Added Pickbox 4 and numbered the error messages.

POLYGONS1.SCR - Changed Pickbox to 4; Made a pickpoint for a selection more accurate.

Revsurf.scr - Added Pickbox 4. Removed an item from the script that was undo anyway (added a point then did undo).

RULESURF1.SCR - Made a couple of selection points more accurate.

Xline_ray.scr - Changed Pickbox to 4.

Xmastree.scr - Changed from Zoom .05 to Zoom Extents to make sure objects that need to be selected were on the screen.
