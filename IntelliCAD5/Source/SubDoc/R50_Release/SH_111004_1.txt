3. Overview:

Tolerance symbols in IntelliCAD do not match the size of tolerance symbols drawn in AutoCAD. 
Unlike the tolerance symbols in AutoCAD, which all use the value of DIMTFAC * DIMTXT as their 
height, The symbols of IntelliCAD have various heights, which normally don't match the size of 
tolerance systems in AutoCAD. This problem is fixed.
