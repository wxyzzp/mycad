3. Overview:

This submission fix the bug #78649 - "Revsurf prompt are different in ACIS builds". 

The command prompts present in ACIS enabled builds were different from those in 
non-ACIS builds. In ACIS builds, the REVSURF command did not terminate unless 
an entity was selected. This behaviour is not compatible with ACAD. This bug is fixed.
