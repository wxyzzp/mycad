Change Overview:
					This submission adds support for DWF export. It also adds support for 
					DWF import, but that code is currently turned off because of a last minute
					spatial index problem.
					
					In addition, it makes a change to the iDrop interface to correctly get the
					TEMP directory in long file name version.
					
						
Notes to Developers:
					I was forced to make DWF support it's own project, to elimiate a bunch
					of header file collisions.

Notes to QA:
					Currently DWF output only outputs version 600 uncompressed version.
					There are two other versions each of which can be uncompressed binary,
					compressed binary, and ascii. This will follow after discussions of how
					to handle the UI.

					DWF import is currently turned off and not ready for testing.

Notes to Docs:
					Note, that DWF export/import as well as SVG export will both need
					documentation.

Notes to Localization:
Strings were added.
