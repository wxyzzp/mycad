Change Overview:
Added code to NEW wizard to fix a problem reported by Dave. It appeared 
to hang icad. I also made new act like acad when either the drawing template
was not found from the wizard and command line.

Change a bit of code to properly handle user input when requesting a template.
Both the wizard, and commandline would not indicate that the requested template
was not found. Now they do and continue by opening an empty default drawing. 
(like our compeditor)

Minor tweak to DWF export dialog.
Added some protective code around setting plot style names to not do it
if the handle being set is NULL.

Made minor change to default line thickness on svg export. The were a bit
to bold.
