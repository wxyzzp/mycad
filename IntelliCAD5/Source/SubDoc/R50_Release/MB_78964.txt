3.  Overview:
	Bug 78964 fix.
	This submission removes the #define	PLACE_DIM_ELEMENTS_TO_0 found in configure.h
	This replaces the (few) references to this #define with a call To actually get 
	the drawing version, and if <= IC_ACAD14 do the things This #define is meant to do.
	So if you open an R14 or less drawing and create a dimension, its parts will Be 
	placed on layer zero. If not, they will be placed on the current layer.

	Sooo.
	If you open an R14 drawing and explode a dimension, its parts will end up on layer zero.
	If you open an R14 drawing and resave it as say R2004 or open a R2004 drawing, then  
	explode the dimension, its parts will be on the layer the dimension is created on.

	In addition, I have removed 63543.log from the regress/log directory and replaced it with
	a generic .txt file to explain what that directory is meant for. I also added such text
	files to the regress/output and regress/output_dxf directories so those directories are
	created when the source code is down loaded. This will make it much easier on members
	running regress for the first time.
