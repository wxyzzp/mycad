1.  Process Checklist:
       *Regress run without new filures: Y (regress.lst)
       *Did you test it?: Y
       *Code reviewed by:
       *Doc Changes Required: N
       *Submitted to branch(es) R50_Release To be merged with Icad_cee.

2.  Modules Affected:
	Resources
	CMDS
	SDS
	DWGdirect

3.  Overview:
	For the most part, this submission prevents editing of proxies. In particular
	it prevents them from being deletable. Copy/move/explode, etc are already not
	allowed on proxy entities, this simply adds delete to the list. In addition, 
	I have added prompts for user feedback on why certain entities in selection
	sets have not been affected by edit commands if they contain proxy entities.

	During some work on ArchT drawings, it was discovered that I was not handling
	polyline thickness correctly. This is fixed by this submission. In addition,
	polylines needed transformation based on their normal direction and for 2D 
	polylines, their elevation. Also added in this submission.

	Utilities.cpp - added some currently commented out code for handling nested
	OdDbBlockReferences. This code will be completed in my next submission.

	I have also uncommented some code in DWGdirectWriter.cpp that was used to
	save .DWF files to a temporary file until it is determained that the save
	succeeded. Upon success, the file is renamed to the final output file name.
	This was the result of an ODT bug (now fixed) that explicitly looked for
	the .dwf extension and if not found, ODT would simply throw an exception.
	This feature now works as designed.
