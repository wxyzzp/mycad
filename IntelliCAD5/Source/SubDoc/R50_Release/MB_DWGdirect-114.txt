2.  Modules Affected:
	DWGdirect

3.  Overview:
	Dave suggested using a map container to hold old handle/new handle pairs
	for a lookup table for OdDbBlockReference processing to find the block it
	is derived from. 


4.  Notes to Docs:
	This situation can happen when you have a r12 drawing with anonymous blocks
	with especially low handle values. The default drawing created for ouput has
	a fair number of handles reserved in the lower values for things like block
	table, styletable, layer 0, standard textstyle etc. It is possible in earlier
	drawing files to have a handle clash between a block your attempting to add to
	the block table and some other object that has the same handle. In that case,
	the old and new handle is saved off for lookup of the new handle when an instance
	of the block in question is created. See DWGdirectConverter::createOdDbBlockReference()
	you'll get it.
