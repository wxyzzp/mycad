3.  Overview:

	This Change provides a fix for the ASSERTS in Debug Build when DIMSTYLE 
Pane of Statusbar is ON and any command is invoked from the command line.
The problem was that in the function, "SetToolBarToCurrentStyle" in the file
"Source\prj\ICAD\icadapi.cpp", the dimension pane of Status bar was being 
updated, which is not at all necessary.
Following was the line that did the job:
	SDS_CMainWindow->m_StatusBar.UpdateCurDimSt();

	The above line has been removed. The code works fine now.

8.  Testing Considerations:

The code should be checked for the following cases:
1. Run the Debug Build Version of Icad.
2. Right-Click the Status Bar.
3. In the Popup menu that appears. Ensure that the "Current Dim Style" Menu 
	is Checked. If it is not Checked, click that option.
4. The Dimension Style Pane should appear in the StatusBar with the Current 
	Dimension Style shown on it.
5. Give the line command.
6. Draw the line.
7. After the line is drawn, you should not get any ASSERTS.
