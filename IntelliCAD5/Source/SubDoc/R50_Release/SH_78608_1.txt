3. Overview:

This submission fixes the following two problems:

  1) The bug #78608 - "Entity selection for SOLIDEDIT command did not support last 
     entity selection option". The problem is fixed by modifing the command framework
     of SOLIDEDIT command to take the last selected entitiy.
     
  2) SOLIDEDIT command did not support BODY entities. This problem is fixed by adding
     DB_BODY type to selection fileter.
