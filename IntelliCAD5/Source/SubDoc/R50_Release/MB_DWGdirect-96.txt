3.  Overview:
	Fix for plote.scr. Actually a band aid. THe problem is in the
	ReactorSubject class where it counts non-deleted reactor subjects.
	The crash occurs because the ReactorSubject data is being corrupted
	somewhere, and has been a problem for a long time. I have added a 
	try/catch block to prevent the crash along with a note that this whole
	reactor attach/detach/destroy complex needs to be revisited.

	Change the verbiage on the failure to recover messagebox.
