3. Overview:

This submission fix the bug #78607 - "SOLIDEDIT command cannot create 
SHELL of solid entity". The problem was the Shell option of Solidedit command
was not implemented correctly and had following problems:

1) The Shell option in AutoCAD asks users to pick a solid first but it did 
   not in IntelliCAD. The prompt was missing in IntelliCAD.
   
2) The implementation for ALL option for Solidedit/Body/Shell was wrong 
   totally so it did not work.

3) When users hit Return key instead of selecting any face and keywork in 
   AutoCAD, all faces of the selected solid will be selected. But IntelliCAD 
   behaved differently. It prompted users to select a face or keywork again.

All problems mentioned above are fixed in this submission.
