3. Overview:

This submission fixes the following preview problems:

   a) The bug #78758 - "ICAD hangs, while browsing through many files in "insert dialog box".
      The problem was when the cursor move to the name of a file listed in the Open File dialog 
      box, the code tried to restore entire database in memory from the file first then looped
      through the whole database to render entity by entity to generate preview image. Scine this
      process is very time consuming, in he case when the users hold the "cursor down" key to 
      browse through many files, ICAD would try to generate preview one by one, which could take a 
      lot of system resource and "hung" the system. This problem is fixed by creating preview from
      the thumbnail image of a drawing.
      
   b) The preview images were lost after the drawing was saved in IntelliCAD. This problem is fixed.
      
   c) The WMF preview images were not supported. This problem is fixed.
