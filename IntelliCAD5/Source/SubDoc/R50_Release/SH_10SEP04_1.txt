3. Overview:

This submission fix the following problems in the code, which caused ICAD to 
crash in clipper.cpp on drawing load:

   1) The line-line intersection function in GEO did not give a correct result 
      in the case the lines are overlapping.
      
   2) The code in CClipper::ClipPolygonByFilter() incorrectly removed all 
      elements from line-line intersection point array in the certain cases, 
      and then tried to access the element of the array using operator[].
      
   3) The cases that two polygons touch on their boundary were not taken 
      account in CClipper::ClipPolygonByFilter().
      
   4) The exception handling was not implemented correctly in CClipper::ClipPolygonByFilter() 
      for the cases when the code is not able to form a new polygon after the 
      original one has been clipped.
