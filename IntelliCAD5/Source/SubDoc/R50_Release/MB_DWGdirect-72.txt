Change Overview:
Added DWG,DXF,and DWT to the file types not to assert in findFile. These
could be xrefs and files that don't need to be translated to icad specific
versions.

Fixed some shutdown problems I was having by verifying that 
SDSApplication::GetEngineApplication() was not returning NULL before making
calls to it.

Commented out a couple of ASSERTS in icadchildwnd.cpp that were just making
me crazy. The would fire every time I open a drawing with the default empty
icad drawing open. Calls to OnSize() and or RecalcLayout were being fired 
because of mouse movements. I have left them in place, and it did no harm
to comment them out, but if someone has strong feeling about putting them
back in be my guest.

Hooked up DWF help.

Initialized m_pibCurToolTip to null in the CIcadToolBarMain constructor in icadtoolbarmain.cpp
to prevent a crash I was experiencing.
Initialized m_pDocument to null in the CIcadView constructor in icadview.cpp
to prevent a crash I was experiencing.

Added code to prevent echoing '<RTMotion NO>' to the command line over and over.
Now the '<RTMotion ?> gets displayed when it actually has something to tell the
user. Also reformatted a couple of functions in icadview.cpp

Added help index for DWF to resource.hm

In reactor.cpp, I change a call from erase() to remove() to prevent a crash during
reactor 'breakage'. I'm not entirely confident it was the right move to make, and
suggest this entire reactor add/remove process be reviewed. 

DWGdirectConverter.cpp
Stephen pointed out that elliptical arcs were being exported as full ellipses. I 
have fixed that in this submission.
Also fixed a problem AUDIT pointed out in that hatch bounaries were sometimes ending
up with reactors with NULL ids. This submission fixes that.
