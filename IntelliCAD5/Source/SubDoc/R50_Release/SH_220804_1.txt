3. Overview:

All the options under the Face and Edge sub-commands of SOLIDEDIT command should 
not have ALL option on "Select a face" and "Select an edge" prompts if no face or 
edge has been selected. But the option incorrectly showed up always and the command
did no thing when ALL option was selected before a face or edge had been seleted.
The problems are fixed.
