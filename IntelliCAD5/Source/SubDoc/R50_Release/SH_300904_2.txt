3. Overview:

If you UNDO a paper space viewport creation, then switch to another an empty layout and create 
a new paper space viewport on that layout, you will see entities in the new viewsport are not 
drawn in correct scale. This problem was caused by incorrectly counting the viewports deleted 
by UNDO as valid entiteis. This problem is fixed.
