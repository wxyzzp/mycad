1. Process Checklist :
* Regress run without new failures: Y
* Did you test it? : Y
* Code Reviewed By: None
* Docs Changes Required: Y
* Submitted to branch(es):

2. Modules Affected :
Available modules: Not Sure.

3.  Overview:
Brief overview of all submissions covered by this subdoc.
A) Added new commands to the File menu:
	Recover
	Audit

Mark Barrow has already added the commands, I just implemented the menus.

B) Removed the Draworder command from the Image Enabler menu.  This was removed since IntelliCAD has it's
own Draworder command on the Tools menu.

C) Rename View->Paper Space Views to be View->Layout Viewports.  I also changed a couple of prompts to 
get rid of references to TILEMODE.  We need to use the Model/Layout terminology and try to get away from
TILEMODE since it is so confusing.

Reviewer's Name and Comments:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Add similar sections for each bug or feature.  Please note submissions for different bug fixes should NOT be clubbed together into one changelog entry. In such cases it is difficult to rollback any one fix or to merge code into release branch for one of the fixes separately.

None

8.  Testing Considerations:
Mark already implemented the commands, this only implements the menus.
Don't forget to check the help text on the commands.
