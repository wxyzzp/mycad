3.  Overview:

Bugzilla 78951
Fix crash in creation of leader with tolerance symbol.

I change the following line in cmdsDimVars.cpp in function cmd_buildEEdList:

// Make sure string values are not NULL otherwise strisame will crash!
if ((ic_rbassoc->resval.rstring) && (plinkvar[fi1].dval.cval) && (strisame(ic_rbassoc->resval.rstring, plinkvar[fi1].dval.cval))) {


On October 4 I checked in similar fixes in several other places in this same file.  After further testing I discovered there were
several other places in the code where these problems exist.  I also initialized a few variables.

Add similar sections for each bug or feature.  Please note submissions for different bug fixes should NOT be clubbed together into one changelog entry. In such cases it is difficult to rollback any one fix or to merge code into release branch for one of the fixes separately.
