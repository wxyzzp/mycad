Description:
Continued fixes for UI bugs:

a) Bhatch dialog - remove "Select Objects" button.  This was not used but remained in the UI.

b) Entity Properties dialog - spin control was not connected to main control, some controls overlapped

c) Print dialog - controls at top of property page overlapped in some DPI settings

d) DWF File and Version dialog - added help button to dialog to provide better placement control (problems with low/high DPI)

e) DWF is Design Web format not Drawing Web Format - changed test accordingly

f) Lineweight dialog - changed help button to match other dialogs, added help id

g) Changed text "Display control polyline frame" to "Display polyline control frame"

h) Drawing Settings->Angular Units/Linear Units - spin controls were not connect to proper parent controls
