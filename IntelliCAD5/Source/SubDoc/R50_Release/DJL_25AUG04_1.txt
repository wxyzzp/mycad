3.  Overview:
Fix Layout Save to support expert.  The script layout_save.scr fails the second time that you run it because it saves to a file and must ask
if you want to overwrite an existing file.  I changed the code to support expert and changed the script to set it. Now the script
can run multiple times without errors.
