	ICAD

3.  Overview:
	This submission fixes a problem with the endpoints of elliptical arcs being off.
	Turns out to be a problem with one of the DWGdirect functions that is used to create
	an ellipse. The fix was to use a couple of redundant DWGdirect calls to force the 
	start and end params to their correct values. I have made the ODT guys aware of the 
	problem, but it is fixed in icad now.

	In addition, I made very minor changes aimed at making future submissions to the 
	Icad_cee stream easier. For the most part, it involves white space removal or addition
	to match the files in the Ican_cee stream.
