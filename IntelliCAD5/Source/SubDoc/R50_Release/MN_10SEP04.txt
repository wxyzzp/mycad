3.  Overview:

	After the discussion with Dave about the "Entity Properties" toolbar problems,
I have added the fixes to limit the sizing of "Entity Properties" toolbar as well as
of "Dimension" toolbar. For that purpose I have changed the style of these toolbars
in  "CreateNewToolBar" function in the file "IcadToolBarMain.cpp". I have also made
some change with the "Entity Properties" toolbar. The last button present on this 
toolbar works the same as second button i.e "Exporer Layers" present on "Entity 
Properties" toolbar.
	Dave also suggested earlier to remove the last button on this toolbar. 
In BricsCAD, this button is also not present. So I have removed the
last button present on the "Entity Properties"toolbar. For that purpose, I have 
made changes in the file "IcadMenuTBDef.H".
	I have also applied the fixes to solve the registry saving problems of this
toolbar. The Combo Boxes on these toolbars should be created before we make a call
to "LoadBarState" function present in "CMainWindow::OnCreate" function in the file
"IcadMain.cpp". For the same purpose, I have created them before this function call.
