Change Overview:
Changes necessitated by Denis's final version of his layout code.
I was having trouble when a layout was renamed or deleted especiall
if they were either Layout1 or Layout2.

In addition, my first purify run found that IntelliCAD was still doing
a loadlibrary on the Visio DWG display component. This was old dead 
code that I have #def'd out.
