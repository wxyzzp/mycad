3.  Overview:
	According to bugzilla description (No. 77937), "Select Boundary Set" button to 
select entities still requires pickpoint selection". That means when we give 
"BHATCH" command and press the "Select Boundary" button, the dialog temporarily
closes and prompts us to select the objects. If we select some entities and 
press "OK" to return back to the dialog, the "OK" button is disabled. According
to bugzilla, it should be enabled. 
	I have studied this in detail and I have reported to Dave that this is not
a bug but some desired functionality is missing i.e the "Select Objects" button 
was missing in the "Boundary Hatch Dialog".
	So I have changed "IcadRes.rc" file to add "Select Objects" button in the
"Boundary Hatch Dialog". I have added a new boolean variable "m_selectObjectsCalled"
in "BHatchBoundaryTab" class in the file "BHatchBoundaryTab.h" file. This variable
becomes true when the user presses "Select Objects" button in "BHATCH" dialog. I 
have added one message map function "OnChooseObjects" for the "Select objects" button
in the file "BHatchBoundaryTab.cpp". I have added a new function "SelectObjects" in the
file "icadboundarydia.cpp". This function does the job of selecting objects as well
as hatching the selected objects. 
	I have also changed the file "bhatchdialog.cpp". When the user presses "Enter" to 
return back to "BHATCH" dialog, the "OK" button should be enabled. I have checked 
the status of "m_selectObjectsCalled" variable in this file and accordingly I have 
enabled the "OK" button.
	I have found one more bug in "BHATCH" dialog. Suppose the user presses the 
"Select Area" button of "BHATCH" dialog and selects some closed areas for hatching.
Then he presses "Esc" button to discard his selection. At that time the "OK" button
should be disabled as in AutoCAD. I have handled this case as well.

8.  Testing Considerations:
The code should be tested for the following steps:
1.	Start IntelliCAD 5.
2.	Draw some entities like circles,rectangles etc.
3.	Give "BHATCH" command.
4.	The "Boundary Hatch" dialog appears.
5.	Press "Select Objects>" button.
6.	Now select the entities.
7.	Press "Enter" to return back to the dialog.
8.	Press "Ok" to complete the command.

Result: The selected entities get hatched.
