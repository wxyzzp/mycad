3.  Overview:
This submission fixes a problem where handles as strings could get truncated.
This was part of the reason for some of the round trip tests to fail. There were
a number of old R12 drawings with 16 digit handles. IntelliCAD & I were truncating
them in some cases. FIXED.

This submission fixes resource versioning where it won't be affected by subsequent
editing via the VC resource editor.

Notes to Developers:

Basic idea of version OR anything in the resource file that is not supposed to be
changed by the resource editor;

Put all #defines and #includes in the '3 TEXTINCLUDE DISCARDABLE' section of the .rc
file.
Then repeat them in the '#ifndef APSTUDIO_INVOKED' section of the .rc file.

See geo.rc for an good simple example.
