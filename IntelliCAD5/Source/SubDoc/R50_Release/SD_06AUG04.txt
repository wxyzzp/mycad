3.  Overview:

	Please refer the Submission Doc CYB_78721_1.txt. This contains the overview of the Bugzilla::78721.

	Later there was a mail from Ron related to DCL and ArcHT that was broken. The issue was 
	related to "fixed_width = true" case.

		<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
		ArchT dialogs that would work with Build_40 do not work with Build_44
		because of an apparent problem with the "fixed_width = true;" attribute

		1. Attached is records.dcl from ArchT
		2. Use code similar to the following to load and test the dialogs
		(defun C:TEST ()
		(setq PATH "\\Arch-T\\archt-intellicad\\Dev\\Support\\DclsIcad\\")
		(setq DLCID (load_dialog (strcat PATH "records.dcl")))
		(new_dialog "record_add" DLCID)
		(start_DIALOG)
		)
		Result: improper argument
		3. Make the following changes to the record_add dialog
		: row {
		: text {
		key = "text1";
		width = 60;
		// fixed_width = true;//Autodsys 042104 Remove this and it works
		4. Run the "TEST" command again
		Result: The dialog displays.  However when you cancel it switches focus to
		the last app and the menus in IntelliCAD are no longer accessible.  This
		does not happen if the dialog loads correctly the first time.
		>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

	Therefore Dave later put back the "else condition" for the assignment for 
	"nHeight = nParentHeight;", that had been removed by me for fixing this bug.
		
	But this opened Bugzilla::78721 again. 
	Later on after looking at the code, I came up to the same question that:
why for all childs the height is supposed to be "nActualChildHeight" 
but for last one it is "nParentHeight"? Logically the assignment of nParentHeight 
to only last child seems wrong. 
	Therefore I modified that statement to:

	"nHeight = ptrThisNode->m_Tile.get_ListOfAttributes()->get_Height();"

	Now we have both the issues solved.

8.  Testing Considerations:

The code should be checked for the following cases:
1. For "boxed_radio_row", the radio buttons should be present at the same level.
2. For "radio_row", the radio buttons should be present at the same level.



9.  Installation Issues:
