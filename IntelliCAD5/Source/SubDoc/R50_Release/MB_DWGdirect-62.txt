Change Overview:
This submission links all dll/exe properties information to blddate.h
I have added .rc files for the ACIS and GEO projects.

I have added the MLBLDVERS string to the Icad about box. Note that I 
wanted to avoid localization issues, so only the version number is shown.

Change OBSCOLOR and OBSLTYPE sysvar names to OBSCUREDCOLOR and OBSCUREDLTYPE
which is what AutoCAD calls them.

Removed an unused variable in DWGdirectReader.

Applied fix for iDrop interface supplied by Stabiplan.

Notes to Developers:

Notes to QA:
Version test on all .dlls and executable file should be performed manually
accross a minimum of two seperate builds.

	ACTION ITEM:
		QA and The build manager should get together on a version numbering 
		scheme. Specifically the format of the MLBLDVERS #define in blddate.h

Please verify that the version number in the Icad about box suites your needs.
