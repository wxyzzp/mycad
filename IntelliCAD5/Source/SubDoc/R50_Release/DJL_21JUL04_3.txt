2. Modules Affected :
Available modules: DB

3.  Overview:
Fixed bugs in Setvar/Getvar implementation

a) Some new variables were available, but had no functionality.  These variables were set to "undocumented" and now 
roundtrip data but will not allow the user to set them.
	BACKGROUNDPLOT
	DRAGP1
	DRAGP2
	FILEDDISPLAY
	GRIPHOVER
	GRIPTIPS
	HPGAPTOL
	INTERSECTIONCOLOR
	LOCALROOTPREFIX
	MTEXTFIXED
	MTJIGSTRING
	MYDOCUMENTSPREFIX
	PALETTEOPAQUE
	PLOTOFFSET
	RASTERDPI
	REPORTERROR
	ROAMABLEROOTPREFIX
	STANDARDSVIOLATION
	TRAYICONS
	TRAYNOTIFY
	TRAYTIMEOUT
	TREEMAX
	UCSORTHO
	UCSVIEW
	XREFNOTIFY
	XREFTYPE
	OSNAPHATCH
	QAFLAGS

b) Fix for bug 78811: Not all variables were in alphabetic order. This was from a bad implementation for variables that 
are stored in the object dictionaries.  This was implemented in a separate list rather than adding a flag to the
existing list of system variables.  Since it was a separate list it could not be integrated into the display of the normal
list alphabetically and had to be displayed after the normal list of variables.

PKSER           "123-123123-12"   (Read Only)
          _VENDORNAME      "PLACE NAME OF ITC MEMBER HERE"   (Read Only)
          _VERNUM          "5.0.1"   (Read Only)
          DIMASSOC         2
          HALOGAP          0
          HIDETEXT         1
          INDEXCTL         0
          OBSCOLOR         0
          OBSLTYPE         0
          PROJECTNAME      ""
          SORTENTS         96
          XCLIPFRAME       0

c) Added support for the PEDITACCEPT system variable. When set to 1, you will not be prompted to "Turn it into a pline?" when
pediting non-polyline entities.

d) Added support for the STARTUP system variable. When set to 1, you will get the start a new drawing wizard when you do a File->new command.
If set to 0, then you just get a new drawing - the wizard does not display.  I also added a check for FILEDIA to the start a new drawing wizard.

e) There were a couple of variables that were not in the correct order in the lists. STANDARDSVIOLATION was not in the correct location in the list of defines
in dbdefines.h.  TDUSRTIMER was not in alphabetical order in db1.cpp which caused it to fail to work at all.

4.  Notes to Docs:
I also changed the print dialog to just say "Print" instead of "Print Dialog".

5.  Notes for Regress/Benchmarks:
New script(s) submitted: Y/N
File Name 		Module Name.
Name of Script file     Name of the module the script tests.
