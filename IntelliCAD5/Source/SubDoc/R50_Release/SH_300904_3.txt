3. Overview:

If a paper space viewport creation was UNDOne and then you switch the layout to another an empty layout, 
you will see the deleted viewports on the original layout are also redrawn on the new viewport once 
and then are erased. This problem is caused by the code incorrectly draw all viewports pointed by 
all records including records marked as deleted in VX table. This problem is fixed.
