3. Overview:

This submissions made the following changes to the code:

    1) Fixed an ACISIN bug, which caused ACISIN command not to work correctly. The problem was 
       the file name entered by users did not pass into the function of the modeler so the SAT 
       files were never found. This bug is fixed.
    2) Added some the code for debug propose to catch ACIS errors.
    3) IntelliCAD brought up a window with title "Visio IntelliCAD Hidden Window" in certain case
       when it failed. I removed "Visio" from those strings defined in hiddenwindow.cpp file.
