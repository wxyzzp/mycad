3.  Overview:
The "Boundary Dialog" defines the object type, boundary set, and island 
detection method for defining boundaries from points you specify. The "Boundary
dialog  box" is a limited version of the Boundary Hatch dialog box. As per
AutoCAD's behaviour the "Select Objects" button should be disabled in "Boundary
Dialog". So to implement this behaviour in ICAD, I have added a new boolean
variable "m_callFromBhatch" in the "Bhatchboundarytab" class in the file 
"bhatchboundarytab.cpp". I have set the value of this varible in the function
"IcadBoundaryHatchDia" of "CMainWindow" class in the file "icadboundarydia.cpp"
just before making a call to "Domodal" function of "BHATCH" dialog's object.
Then I have checked the value of "m_callFromBhatch" variable in "OnInitDialog"
function of "Bhatchboundarytab" class in the file "bhatchboundarytab.cpp" for
making "Select Objects" button enabled..
