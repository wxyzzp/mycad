	DWGDIRECT

3.  Overview:
	Changed prior fix for plote.scr failures to a hybrid of what 
	was alread in my last submission, and what was done in the icad_cee 
	stream. Turns out you can't rely on the handitem member of the ReactorItem
	to be valid. I've added a call to use the ReactorItem handle member to actuall
	retrieve the handitem from the data base.
