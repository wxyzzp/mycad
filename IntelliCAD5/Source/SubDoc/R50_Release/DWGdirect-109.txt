3.  Overview:
	This submission adds new SDS functionallity. I have added (member requested)
	sds_getpreviewbmp() to retrieve the image preview from drawing files from 
	within sds applications. We can also us it internally I believe.
	The signature is;

	int sds_getpreviewbmp(const char *szFileName, void** pHBITMAP, unsigned long* pAllocatedBytes, short* bIsBitmap);
	It should be noted that *pHBITMAP is allocated and must be freed by the user.
