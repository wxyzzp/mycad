2.  Modules Affected:
	DWGDIRECT

3.  Overview:
	Added test for NULL handitem pointer in DWGdirectConverter.cpp.
	Uncommented BUILD_WITH_RENDERING_SUPPORT for lightworks support in 
	configure.h.
	Cleaned up code to delete Layout1 to include deleting the Block and
	viewport associated with it.
	Fixed a problem with XREFS where I was trying to add them to the 
	database twice. Also made a call on output to set XREF pathnames correctly.
	Fixed a block ID lookup problem I was having with anonymous blocks.
	I have changed the code to look up the block by name in the ICAD data
	base, get its handle, then use that handle to look up the block's ID
	in the OdDbDatabase. Because anyonumous blocks can change based on the
	order in which they are added to the block table, using names was
	not reliable. Now it is. This fixes an ARCHT problem we have seen.
