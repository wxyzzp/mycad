3. Overview:

This submission fix the bug #6394 - "Chamfer using Angle option doesn't 
work with 3D Xlines or 3D Rays". The problem was the underlying code of chamfer
using a bounded line as infinite line(xline or ray) to compute the intersection
of two entities and create chamfer by angle. When the pick point was outside 
of the bound of the line, it incorrectly classified the point was also out of the 
bound of the xline or ray hence led to an incorrect result. This problem was no 
thing to do with 3D Xline or ray and also appear for 2D xlines and rays. This 
bug is fixed.
