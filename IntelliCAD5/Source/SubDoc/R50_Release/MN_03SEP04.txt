3.  Overview:
	
	I have made the changes in the file "insert.cpp" in the CMDS module to 
solve the bugzilla 78869. The bugzilla description of this bug is as follows:
 "Cannot INSERT DWG file with "." (period) in filename".
	According to Bugzilla description, when the user creates a drawing like 
"a.b.dwg" and then gives the "Insert" command to insert this drawing as
a block in new drawing, the user gets the error message as "Could not find file
"c:\...\a.b.dwg".
	This problem was present in the function "ProcessInsertBlockName" in the file
"insert.cpp". In this function there is a variable "blkfile" which stores the full
path of the file as "c:\....\a.b.dwg". In this function, there is some block of
codes written to remove ".dwg" part from the "blkfile" variable. Due to that
part, this bug was produced. I have commented this part to solve this bug.

8.  Testing Considerations:
The code should be tested for the following steps:
1.	Start IntelliCAD 5.
2.	Draw some entities.
3.  Save this drawing as "a.b.c.dwg". (any name with periods in it)
4.  Close this drawing. 
5.	Start a new drawing.
6.	Give "insert" command.
7.  Select the "Browse" option.
8.  Browse to the location where we save "a.b.c.dwg" file.
9.  Provide other informations at command prompt to insert this block.
10. The block is inserted.
11. Check the result with AutoCAD.
