3.  Overview:


Mohan (Bugzilla::78808)
	As per the Bugzilla description, there is a CRASH, when we click the '?' 
button in any Dialog. Actually a Help-file related topic should pop-up if the 
related Help is installed.
	I have modified the file "Source/prj/ICAD/icadmain.cpp". This was caused as 
a side effect to the fix for Bugzilla::78663.
	There are some dialogs which have specific Help IDS associated with them.
The previous fix was for the "setfunhelp" implementation fix did not check for
the case "(dwData > HLP_TCOPTIONS)" in the function CMainWindow::IcadHelp.
There is a condition which should not be executed for the Help IDS for the Dialog
but skip the check and execute the later part.
	This has been taken care of by intoducing the condition "(dwData > HLP_TCOPTIONS)"
in the if Statement, and thus this crash has been avoided.

	
Mohan (Bugzilla::78761)	
	As  per bugzilla description, there is an incompatibility to purge a block 
by name, using purge -block command. In AutoCAD it is possible to purge a block 
by name, using purge -block[blockname]. This is not the case in IntelliCAD. 
	So I have added new entries in the stringtable  in "icad.rc2" 
file. For these strings I have provided the unique IDs in "icadrc2.h" file. I
have added a new function "SetPurgeBlockName" in "purge.cpp" file. The purpose
of this function is to retrieve a string one by one from the list of strings 
separated by "comma". I have also made the changes in the same file in the 
function "purge_drawing". 
	The purpose of the function "purge_drawing" is to purge unreferenced entries 
depending upon the user's choice i.e. purge layer, purge block,purge dimension styles , 
purge styles etc. I have made the changes in this function so that the user can purge 
the blocks by their names as in AutoCAD. 
	I have also provided the same functionality to other cases i.e layers, styles,
dimension styles and linetypes.


Sachin.
	Dave has supplied the new BMPS for the Splash Screens for Professional and 
Standard versions. I have checked them in.
