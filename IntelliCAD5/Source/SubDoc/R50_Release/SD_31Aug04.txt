3.  Overview:

	This Change provides a way to have seperate settings for Professional 
and Standard Versions of IntelliCAD 5.0 under different trees in Registry. 
This will enable the end-user to run both the versions on the same machine 
without any conflicts.
	If there were 2 versions viz: Professional and Standard of IntelliCAD 5.0 
on the same machine, then each one would overwrite the other programs settings
because both of them wrote at the same tree in Registry.
	This confusion has now been removed. 
	The Professional Version will now save its settings under
"IntelliCAD 5.0 Professional" tree while the  Standard Version will now save 
its settings under "IntelliCAD 5.0 Standard" tree.
