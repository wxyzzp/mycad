3.  Overview:
Added a collection class to allow me to delay conversion of proxy object references.
Only to find that there is no way for me to assign references to OdDbProxyObjects.
I have contacted ODT on the problem.

Changed the return value of makeHatchBoundaryAssociations() so I could detect
if there was a problem with the boundary. If a problem is found, I simply make the
hatch non-associative. 

Fixed a memory leak in cleaning up resbuf chains created by converting OdResbuf data
to IntelliCAD's sds_resbuf data and back.

Turned script 78393_T1fts011.scr back on in regress.lst. This submission fixes it.
