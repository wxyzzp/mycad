3.  Overview:
	Added code to display a message to users when a drawing requires RECOVERy.
	Added code to test a pointer for NULL prior to use. This was the cause of
	a file open crash.
	During the mad scramble to test some last minute files that failed to open,
	I added code to prevent db_inserts without corresponding block definitions
	from being created. This was the cause of at least one failure.
	Added code to change the dialog title of the open dialog to "Recover Drawing"
	when RECOVER is the active command.
	Also submitting MB_DWGdirect-94.txt which didn't make it in with my last
	submission.
