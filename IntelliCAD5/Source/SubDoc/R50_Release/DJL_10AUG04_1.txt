In C:/Project/IntelliCAD/R50_Dev/IntelliCAD/Source/Regress/scripts_error :
              78168_linetype.scr
              78328.scr
              78346j.scr
              bhatch_options_1.scr
              bhatch_options_3.scr
              boundary_options_1.scr
              Break.scr
              colcir.scr

Affected files:
In C:/Project/IntelliCAD/R50_Dev/IntelliCAD/Source/prj/lib/CMDS :
    modified: cmds3.cpp

Description:
The linetype create feature was not writing out the new linetype correctly.  This was causing a couple of linetype creation scripts to fail
every second time the scripts were run.  I also threw in a little extra error checking in a spot that concerned me.

Reference: DJL_10AUG04_1.txt Bugzilla: 75159

Affected files:
In C:/Project/IntelliCAD/R50_Dev/IntelliCAD/Source/prj/lib/CMDS :
    modified: cmds3.cpp

Description:
Using the Pedit select feature did not return the correct vertext point (closest to the point selected)

Add similar sections for each bug or feature.  Please note submissions for different bug fixes should NOT be clubbed together into one changelog entry. In such cases it is difficult to rollback any one fix or to merge code into release branch for one of the fixes separately.

7.  System file - Component Changes and Additions
None

8.  Testing Considerations:
Re-test all the new scripts by placing them in the scripts directory and running the entire regression set.

The linetype creation feature needs to be tested for four situations:
  Creating a new linetype file
  Appending a new linetype to an existing linetype file
  Replacing an existing linetype in an existing linetype file
  Replacing the only linetype in a linetype file

Re-test pedit edit vertext select - be sure to try to get the first and last vertex points

9.  Installation Issues:
Anything the members need to be aware of when creating their installers for the product.
