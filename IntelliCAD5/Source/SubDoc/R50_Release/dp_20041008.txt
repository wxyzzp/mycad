3.  Overview:

Steps to create the paint problem:
1. Open a drawing in AutoCAD 
2. Open IntelliCAD 
3. Draw a circle in the current drawing 
4. Try to open the same file in IntelliCAD that is currently loaded in AutoCAD 
5. IntelliCAD will ask if you want to open the file as a read-only drawing 
6. Answer “No”

Expected:
The drawing opened is cancelled and you are returned to the previous drawing file with a circle in it.

Actual:
The drawing open is cancelled and the current drawing display is corrupted.  
The display cannot be fixed with Regen or Redraw, but if you minimize and maximize the drawing window then the display is fixed.

On initialization of new MDI window it creates child windows, views and controls.
These views are also moved and resized in order to create necessary lay-out.
View that does not belong to given MDI window has been incorrectly resized.
