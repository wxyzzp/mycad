3. Overview:

This submissions fixes the bug# 78967 - FILLET silently fails on several available ACIS edges.
The reason that FILLET failed on those edges is ACIS API was not able to identify the picked edges
by using the pick point and viewing direction given in IntelliCAD to perform ray-entity hit test. 
The API function only return hit points and entities in forward direction. But for the test
case, the pick point given by IntelliCAD is actually behind the solid after it is transformed from
UCS to WCS. The bug is fixed by also performing ray-hit testing in reversed direction. The code for
ray-loop hit test is changed to fix similar problem.
