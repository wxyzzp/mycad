3.  Overview:
The script vports_options.scr was failing on my machine.  I found that an exception was being thrown during the
creation of a viewport because the ur and ll points were out of range.  These exceptions were not being caught
until it went all way out to SaveModified() which trys to save the drawing before IntelliCAD dies. I added some error checking to make sure
these stayed within range.  No one else was able to repro this bug, it could be becuase I have a high res 
monitor.
