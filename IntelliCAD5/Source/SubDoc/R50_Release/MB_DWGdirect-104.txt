2.  Modules Affected:
	DWGdirect

3.  Overview:
	Backed out the change that prevented .vbi files from being created for
	every .dwg file being saved. THis change was causing threading problems
	that caused IntelliCAD to hang when saving (Only in Professional version)

	A number of scripts were putting their output in the source/regress directory
	instead of the source/regress/output directory. I have change the scripts that
	did that.

	Note, because .vbi files are now being created, these scripts will appear to
	fail. It is because they cannot overwrite the .vbi file on the second save.
	This is not a problem from the command line, and probably will need a different
	(Professional specific) version of the script. For the short term These scripts
	should probably be avoided during regression runs.
