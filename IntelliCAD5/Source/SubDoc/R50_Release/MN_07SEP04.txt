3.  Overview:
	
	I have added the fixes given by Kartik Iyer in the files "LayerComboBox.cpp"
and "ColorComboBox.cpp" present in ICAD module.
	According to Kartik's description, when the current layer is changed, the 
current color and current line type combo box displays get reset to BYLAYER, but
actually the color and line type remain as the original settings (as they should). 
	For this bug, he applied the fixes in the file "LayerComboBox.cpp" in the 
function "OnSelchange()". The other bug is that if you select a custom color from
the "Color Combo Box", it appears in the "Color Combo Box" and you can use it for 
drawing. If you select a custom color in the "Color Combo box" it does not actually 
select the color in the dropdown but defaults to "BYBLOCK"  instead. 
	For this bug, Kartik has applied the fixes in the file "ColorComboBox.cpp" in the 
function "OnSelchange()".
	I have added these fixes in both files to solve these two bugs.
