Change Overview:
	This submission turns on DWF import. I had some minor changes
	to make to turn on the spacialFilter creation, and this now
	makes import of .dwf files possible.

Notes to Developers:

Notes to QA:
	Currently ONLY modelspace entities are being written out. AND they
	are imported as a block named viewport0 into Layout1. I discussed this
	with the ODT guys, and it seems we are the only ones using this right
	now and they have had no feed back on it. In addition, they claim that
	paperspace layout should also be suppoorted which they currently don't
	seem to be.
	I have suggested that viewport0 be be placed in the model space layout
	instead of Layout1, and they are considering it. Also I expect import of
	paperspace layouts to come on line soon too. They are currently exported
	correctly.

Notes to Docs:
	DWF import needs to be documented. However, I would wait until the
	things discussed in 'Notes to QA:' have bee flushed out.
