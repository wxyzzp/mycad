3.  Overview:
	This submission turns back on the code that prevents .vbi files
	from being created when no VBA project has been created for a give
	drawing. This originally caused IntelliCAD Pro to hang. 
	After further research, it turns out that the hang was in a loop
	updating the MRU menu items on the &File menu. The reason was a bit
	strange, but I have a solid fix and have applied it.
	Turns out there were two calls at the top of GetMRUString() that were
	not initiallizing correctly. It was creating a CString and then calling
	CString::Empty() on it to create an empty string if the index passed in
	was greater than the allowable index. Well that call was (for some reason)
	putting '.Dwg' in the string instead. Since it was not an empty string
	processing simply continued, and since it NEVER was empty, the for loop
	hung the process.
	FIXED.  
	If you want the details diff IcadApp.cpp 1.28.4.21.2.9 whith the latest 
	version.
