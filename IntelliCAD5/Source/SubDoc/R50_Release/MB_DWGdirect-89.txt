1.  Process Checklist :
* Regress run without new failures: Y (regress.lst)
* Did you test it? : Y
* Code Reviewed By: 
* Docs Changes Required: N
* Submitted to branch(es):	R50_Release & Icad_cee

2.  Modules Affected : 
	API
	ACAD
	DWGdirect
	GR

3.  Overview:
This submission fixes a couple of sever memory problems I introduced. I was
deleting the same memory pointers twice in proxy entities, and in the vector
generation code. This was in turn causeing big problems in greedy heap.

In addition, I have submitted a submission test regression .lst file.

9.  Installation Issues:

Notes to Developers:
Using regression.exe, all developers SHOULD run checkintest_std.lst as a pre-checkin step.
This file will eventually contain less and less files as the scripts that are either very
time consuming or redundant are commente out from the file. This will eventually lead to 
a regression run that is resonable from a time standpoint. Currently it contains 640
scripts, and on my 3.2GHz machine takes about 45 minutes to run. Hopefully this will become
more like 20 minutes as the number of scripts are reduced. 
This should be treated as the minimum regression test for submitting code.
