3.  Overview:

Mohan:
i. While resizing the "Entity Properties" toolbar,comboboxes namely layer,color,
   line type and line weight are not seen after certain limit.While creating these
   comboboxes in "IcadMain.cpp" file, proper IDs are not given to them. So I have
   given the proper IDs to them in the same file.
ii. As suggested by Dave, we should use BYLAYER and BYBLOCK consistently in IntelliCAD
   instead of ByLayer and ByBlock. So for the same reason, I have replaced "ByLayer"
   and "ByBlock" entries present in "Icad.rc2" file by "BYLAYER" and "BYBLOCK" 
   respectively. I have made the same changes in the file "LineweightDlg.cpp" in
   "SetTextForCurrentLWeight()" member function of "CLineweightDlg" class as well
   as in the file "IcadLWListBox.cpp" in the overiding function "DrawItem" of 
   "CIcadLWListBox" class.
	I have also made changes in "LWeightComboBox.cpp" file in the functions "DrawItem"
	and "MeasureItem" to change the appearance of "line weight combo-box" properly.


Sachin:
i. I have introduced "IntelliCAD 5" Tree in Registry under ITC, so that from 
   now on all future changes in Registry regarding ICAD 5 will be made under 
   this tree. 
ii. This was necessary to allow multiple versions of IntelliCAD to run on the 
   same machine at end user. Otherwise settings from one version say ICAD 4
   used to get over-ridden with settings from another version say ICAD 5.
