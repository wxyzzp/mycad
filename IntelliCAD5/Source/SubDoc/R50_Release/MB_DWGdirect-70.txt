Change Overview:
This submission completes the AUDIT command implementation.

Notes to Developers:

Notes to QA:

Overview;
When auditing the current drawing, I basically take the current
in-memory drawing, and create an OdDbDatabase from it. I then execute
a DWGdirect audit on the new OdDbDatabase. If no errors are found, that's
the end of the processing (a little over-simplified). If however, there
are errors, and the user has choosen to fix them, the new fixed OdDbDatabase
is used to create a new db_drawing. The previous version of the document's
db_drawing is then deleted, some patchwork is performed, and the new 
db_drawing is substituted into the current document in place of the old 
db_drawing that had errors in it.

What this means, is that if you perform the Audit multiple times, and the
same errors reappear, then the problem is in the translation from db_drawing
to OdDbDatabase or from the OdDbDatabase back to a db_drawing. In any case
it should be buged if multiple audits on the same drawing result in the 
same errors.
