Change Overview:
This submission goes as far as it can with round tripping VBA projects.
	Changed the way db_vbaproject's DWGdirect data is saved in Icad form.
	VBA projects were being save via DWGdirect dxfFiler, because a call to
	export a VBA project was missing. I have assurances from ODT, that the
	setVBAproject() method was being added. Currently all but the binary
	data is being saved out. Change reader to use the getVbaProject() call;

This submission goes as far as it can with round tripping SortentsTables.
	Fixed code to read/write sortentstables. However, there is currently
	no way to export the handle pairs needed. ODT has assured me it will 
	be added. Only the handle pairs are missing from the export at this
	time. It will be fixed once ODT has updated the libs.

Added a couple of default block names to an ASSERT in read.cpp
Fixed a problem with image sizing that Denis made me aware of.
