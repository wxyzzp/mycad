Description:	This submission fixes a bug from my last submission in table.cpp. Fixed lint problem in same file.
Comments:	This submission fixes a bug in LISP\table.cpp. A resbuf was previously being deleted which I changed to a
		sds_relrb(). I need to set the rbnext pointer of this resbuf to NULL -- or else it will free buffers which
		it should not. This was fixed in lsp_modify_adslist().
		Also fixed a lint warning in table.cpp -- In function lsp_tblobjname() removed a local variable (rb) 
		which was set but not used.
