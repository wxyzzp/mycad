Reference:		BugZilla:78394
Added files:     	
Affected files: 
		Source/prj/ICAD/mtextpropsheet.cpp
		Source/prj/ICAD/IcadMtextDia.cpp
Description:	Cancel button on Mtext dialog not working.
Comments:		TaL78394
Problem Analysis:
		In either cases i.e. when the user presses OK or Cancel, the flow was through CMTextPropSheet::OnDestroy( ). In this function, the code for changing text height, text width, rotation angle, alignment, text style and the text  itself were making the changes permanent.

Proposed Solution:
		Move the code for changing text height, text width, rotation angle, alignment, text style and the text to the function void CMainWindow::IcadMTextDia( ), inside the case if(ret == IDOK).  				
File by File:	
*		Source/prj/ICAD/mtextpropsheet.cpp
		Commented code which was setting the text properties as listed in the problem analysis above.
*		Source/prj/ICAD/IcadMtextDia.cpp
		Added code for setting these text properties.
