Description:    Fixed bug #78427 - "isometric viewpoint prints topview, and 
                ends up as another view", which was introduced by one of the
                later changes that overrided my previous change to fix this
                problem. The bug was in CIcadView::FilePrint(), which changed
                ucs to plan view.
                
                My last submission only fixed the problem for printing meshes. 
                This submission fixes the same problem shown up while ICAD is
                printing wireframes.
