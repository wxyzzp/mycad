Description:	This submission fixes the bug #78550 - "In ACIS enabled build Rulesurf between 
                point and line is not created". 
                
                In ACIS enabled build, the Rulesurf command creates surfaces as ACIS bodies
                rather than polylines. The implementation did not support point, I guess, is 
                because the command was implementation by using ACIS skinning API function 
                to create surfaces, which can only fit the surface from two disconnected edges.
                
		To fix the problem, I changed cmd_edgesurf_acis() function by adding DB_POINT
		to selection filter list to enable to select point as input and the code to 
		create two additional boundary curves and form the surface from the connected 
		boundary curves when one of selected entities is a point. I also added the code
		to verify user input and prompt users to select the second entity again if 
		both selected entities are points. A string index for a new error message is 
		added to icadrc2.h and the new error messages is added to icad.rc2 file.
