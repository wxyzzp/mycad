DESCRIPTIONS:	
 
 	This submission fixes following two separated problems reported in 
 	the bug #70921:
 	
           1) Hatching geometry that includes elliptic or circular arcs may 
              fail in certain circumstances. 
                
           2) Hatch patterns are not trimmied correctly by boundary curves in 
              certain circumstanses if one of boundaries is elliptic arc.
              
	The first problem was due to the limitation of Newton-Raphson method. It
	failed to find the intersections of elliptic and elliptic arcs in cetain
	cases. This problem is fixed by using an analytic method rather than 
	numerical method to compute the intersections of elliptic and elliptic 
	arcs for those cases. 
	
	The second problem was introduced by an early change, which incorrectly 
	used the parameters rather than (start and end) angles to construct the 
	elliptic boundary curve of bhatch so the curves were not actually bounded 
	at the intersections of the boundary curves. This problem is fixed by 
	reversing that change.
