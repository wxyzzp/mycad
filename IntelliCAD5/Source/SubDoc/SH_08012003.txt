DESCRIPTIONS:	
 
 	This submission fixes the bug #78350 - Union operation functions like subtract
 	in the case that wedge and torus are united.
 	
 	The problem is, in the case, the wedge created by WEDGE command is invalied. 
 	The WEDGE command was not implemented correctly so it created either incorrect
 	result(valid solid with wrong position) or invalid solid(some of faces were not 
 	oriented correctly) whenever the any coordinate fo the first input point is 
 	smaller than the coordinate of the second inputed corner point. This bug is
 	fixed.
	

CHANGED FILES:	
	
	Source/Prj/Lib/ACIS/AsMesh.cpp:       Changed mesh::wedge().
