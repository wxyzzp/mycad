		This bug fixed was tried to be fixed by 4M Item:145. But this does not seem to 		work as expected in the current developement branch. 
		
		There were two problems:
		1. On redraw the entity drawn were erased and only one text entity was drawn with 		all inputs.
		2. ortho on/off the point selected used to move.

		To solve the first problem, SDS_cmdcharbuf which is an extern variable and has 		the keyboard typed buffer was used and was cleared after taking the input.

		Ortho On / off should not make any difference in Dtext. So its current value was 		saved and it was reset to 0 and then after the work done its originl value was 		again restored.
