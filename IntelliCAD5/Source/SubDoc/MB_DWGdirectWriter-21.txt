Change Description:
Added support for password encryped drawing read. Note I added a
dialog box to resources to get/set the password from the user. It has
its short commings, because I have no way to hook the process to handle
users putting in the wrong password. Currently it just leaves the dialog
up until either the valid password is entered, or the cancel button is pressed.
If the password is correct, the drawing is opened.

Note: to save a file with a password. You'll of course need to be using the
DWGdirect save code path. Once you select AutoCAD 2004 as the ouput format
on the SaveAs dialog, the 'Password protect' check box will activate. If you
then select (check) it, you will be prompted for a pass word which will then
be imbedded in the .dwg. Note .DWG is the only file format that has password
protection.
	
Added some code to handle Proxy Objects. It is currently
commented out while I communicate with the ODT guys on some data
I don't seem to have access to.

Notes to Localization:
I have added a new dialog and supporting #defines. Particular attention
needs to be given when translating to another language.
