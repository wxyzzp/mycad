Description:	This submission adds the source for regress_icad_acad_bench application.
Comments:	This regress application benchmarks icad and acad for 2 cases -- open of dwg files and open followed by save of
		dwg files. If the third argument is set to 0, the benchmark performs open of dwg files only. Setting it to 1
		performs open and save.

		Usage is 

		regress_icad_acad_bench "Directory_to_process" "Output_Directory" 0

		The benchmark executable process all dwg files in the "Directory_to_process". It recurses to find all
		dwg files in the hierarchy and processes them. It writes the output files in the same directory structure
		under "Output_Directory". 

		It is IMPORTANT that "Output_Directory" be not present under "Directory_to_process". If it is, the processing
		will never end.

		The regress_icad_acad_bench executable saves dwg files and dxf files with the same prefix as the dwg
		file it is processing. For each directory under "Directory_to_process" it processes, it creates 2 directories 
		output_R14 and output_acad_R14. The saved dwg files (if optin is set to 1) are placed here.

		Required system variables :-

		ICAD_REGRESS_EXE_PATH -- This has the complete path (including icad.exe) to the icad executable.
		ACAD_REGRESS_EXE_PATH -- This has the complete path (including acad.exe) to the acad executable.
		The following are optional --
		TT_EXE -- True Time executable
		ICAD_TT_REGRESS_EXE_PATH -- ICAD executable instrumented with TrueTime.
		BC_EXE -- Boundschecker executable.
		TC_EXE -- Truecoverage executable.
		ICAD_COV_REGRESS_EXE_PATH -- ICAD executable instrumented with TrueCoverage.
		PURIFY_EXE -- Purify executable.
		ICAD_PURIFY_EXE -- Icad executable instrumented by Purify.

		Output file :-

		c:/icadregress.log
