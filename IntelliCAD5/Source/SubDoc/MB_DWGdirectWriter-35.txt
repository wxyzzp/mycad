Change Description:
This submission allows proxy entities to display in IntelliCAD.
It is a partial implementation at this point, because currently
only polylines and circular arcs have their callback functions filled
in, but it is a major step toward full display support for proxies.

In addition, I fixed a couple of typos I found in curve.cpp which 
were causing me to get some bogus data back.
