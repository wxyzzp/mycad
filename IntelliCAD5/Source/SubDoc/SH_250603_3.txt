Description:	This submission fixes the bug #78549 - Elliptical arc is not 
                created correctly. In the case given in the bug report, the 
                elliptic arc created is supposed to have start angle as 270 but 
                actual result has start angle as 90. The problem is in cmd_ellipse(),
                the start angle returned by sds_getangle() was used as the start 
                angle of elliptic arcs, which is wrong. The value returned by 
                sds_getangle() is w.r.t. UCS but not ECS. It needs to plus the 
                axis angle(the angle between zero axis of ellipse and UCS' x- 
                axis) before it is used to create elliptical arc. This problem 
                is fixed.
