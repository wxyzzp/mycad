		The actual reason for this bug was wrong value in global varibale
		"IEXP_EntityCol[IEXP_CurrentIndx].CurrentName".
		While renaming a table record current index table record name is copied into 		IEXP_EntityCol[IEXP_CurrentIndx].CurrentName which leads to problem while 		deleting the table record. Looking at 		IEXP_EntityCol[IEXP_CurrentIndx].CurrentName in it seems that we are deleting a 		table record which is set current and hence we have to change the current to 		something else and hence we use to get two current entries in table records.
		To solve this problem we have initialised the value of global variable				IEXP_EntityCol[IEXP_CurrentIndx].CurrentName to the current of table record. This 		prevents the above problem. The problem was for layer, linetype, style and 				dimension style. All these cases are fixed.
