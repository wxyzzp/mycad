Change Description:
Completes code to round trip minserts.

In addition, I came across a problem with CDbLayout and CDbPlotSettings
which CDbLayout is derived from.
Both contain a flags variable that is set/get via the set_70() and get_70()
calls. The one in CDbLayout was commented out with a note that the CDbPlotSettings
flag would be used. The problem is that both of these classes us bits 0x1 and 0x2
for different things. I checked with Denis, and he actually convinced me that
the fix I proposed (uncomment the set_70()/get_70() of CDbLayout) would overwrite
the ones for CDbPlotSettings. However, the ones in CDbPlotSettings have overwritten
the ones in CDbLayout.
I have implemented a (possibly) temporary fix by renaming the CDbLayout set/get_70() 
functions to set_Layout70() and get_Layout70(). This allows both flags to exist 
independant of one another. There may be some entget ramifications that I need to
ponder, and I am awaiting Denis' input. However, I am making this change to allow
Denis and me to proceed.

Note: I don't anticipate any problems, because the CDbLayout 70 group accessors have
been commented out for some time.
