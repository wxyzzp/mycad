		NoTE:
		-----
		In IntelliCAD the size of DIMPOST and DIMAPOST is limited to 16 characters. Out 		of these 16 characters 1 character will be for '\0' and 2 characters will be for 		delimiters ( [ ] or < > ) of DIMAPOST or DIMPOST. So actaully we can have only 13 		characters Prefix or Suffix.

		Problem fix :
		------------
		The function svar_StrSet() is called on every character type in the edit boxes Of 		DIMPOST and DIMAPOST. So whenever the size of DIMPOST exceed its limit there were 		message boxes on screen stating so. But as this function is called on evey 		character, when 2-3 characters we extra there were messages poping continuosly. 		This was the problem. To fix this problem We had to take a static variable ( 		bDialogDisplayed ) which will save the state Dialog displayed on screen.

		Second problem was that we would pop a message that the size of DIMPOST exceed 		the limit and also  set the DIMPOST system varaible which was truncated. BUT this 		truncated value was never updated back to the edit boxes. This is done here. Only 		important point to note here is DIMPOST can be only 13 characters So Length of 		Suffix will be 13-length of Prefix.
