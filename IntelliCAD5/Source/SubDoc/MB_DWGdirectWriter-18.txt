Change Description:
Had to do some work on getting layouts straight for export.
Basically, I had some handle clashes that can't be avoided, but
I feel pretty good about the fix, and will be keeping my eye on 
it.

Notes to Developers:

Notes to QA:
Note; I have left several ASSERT()s in the code that may or may
not fire when testing on a debug build. In most cases you can 
simply ignore them. They are mostly to keep me from forgetting to
address objects that are in progress. There will be some minor loss
in data until all the asserts have been addressed, but they are mostly
objects like extension dictionary entries I haven't addressed yet.
