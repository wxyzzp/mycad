Project IntelliCAD development

Change Description:
Added support for round tripping Tolerances.

Note that if the dimstyle has say arial as its text style,
IntelliCAD shows ???? in place of the text. This is an 
IntelliCAD problem (I believe with resolving in-line font changes),
that is the same with or without DWGdirect active.

Notes to Developers:

Notes to QA:
With the exception of proxies, and wipeout entities, this completes
the entity list (I believe). If you find any entities that we don't
round trip please let me know ASAP.

I say entities as opposed to objects!!! There are still several objects
yet to be supported. I.e spatial Indexes, layer Indexes, some types of
dictionary entities, VBA projects etc.
