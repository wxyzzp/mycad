Description:	This submission fixes the problems in the ACIS releated code to make 
                solid functionality work.

Comments:	There were many problems in the ACIS releated code in ICAD sub-project
                ACIS, which caused build to fail and the solid functionalities failed to
                work, Many ACIS functions were used in the code but the correcponding 
                ACIS header files were not included. Also the names of the exported 
                functions defined in ACIS.Dll didn't match names called in db\modeler.cpp. 
                This submission fixed all of those problems to make solid functionality 
                work.

Build:          The environment variable A3DT must be defined and all ACIS DLLs must
                be copied to the same directory as ACIS.DLL.
