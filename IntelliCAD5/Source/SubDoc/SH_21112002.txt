Description:	This submission fixes bugs #78359, #78355, #78364, and #78357. This 
                submission also fixed some of memory leaks.

Comments:	BUG #78359 - Full ACIS-ICAD crashes on cancelling chamfer command

                RESOLUTION: It crashed because the implementation for UNDO for solid 
                            operations was based on wrong assumption that data size 
                            will not change after an operation. This is fixed by 
                            re-implementing UNDO functions.
                            
                BUG #78355 - (Full ACIS)-Moving a newly created solid using grips 
                              moves the entity multiple times.
                              
                RESOLUTION: The reason that solids were moved multi-times distance 
                            because it was implemented to take an action for each 
                            grip point. This is incorrect for selecting a grip point 
                            to move solid. This is fixed.
                            
                BUG #78364 - Full Acis - Extrude does not work
                BUG #78357 - (ACIS) Revolve command does not work.
                
                RESOLUTION: They didn't work because they were not implemented for
                            LINE,ARC,ELLIPSE,CIRCLE,POLYLINE,LWPOLYLINE,SPLINE. The
                            implementation for those entities has been added.
