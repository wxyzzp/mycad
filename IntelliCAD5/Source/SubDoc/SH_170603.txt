Description:	This submission fixes the bug #78521 - "Properties dialog does not show 
                properties of 3d entities". It is reported for 3DSolid entities but I 
                found that region and body entities also had the same problem.
                
	        As color, layer, linetype, linetypescale, and thickness, the line weight 
	        is also an item of general entity property control and not an item of 
	        ent_REGION_TAB, ent_3DSOLID_TAB, and ent_BODY_TAB control. But the code 
	        in ent_REGION_TAB::DoDataExchange(), ent_3DSOLID_TAB::DoDataExchange(),
		and ent_BODY_TAB::DoDataExchange() functions tried to send the value of the 
		line weight to ent_REGION_TAB, ent_3DSOLID_TAB, ent_BODY_TAB controls, which 
		causes MFC to give an assert in CDialog::DoDataExchange() in the debug build 
		and fire an exception in the release build. The problems have been fixed by 
		changing 
				
		   start += 5;
		   
		to 
		   start += 6;
		   
		to skip the line weight to prevent to sent it to the control.
