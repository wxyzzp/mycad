Description:    This submission fixes the following SOLIDEDIT bugs:

                1) IMPRINT was not able to imprint the curves to the
                   faces of solids because it was implemented to imprint
                   intersection graph of the bodies to the bodies. 
                   
                2) Hiting the return key while IMPRINT is prompting
                   users to select the curves automatically terminated
                   SOLIDEDIT command.
                   
                3) The solids were not hightighted after they were 
                   selected at IMPRINT.
                   
                4) UNDO command was not able to undo changes made by 
                   SOLIDEDIT command.
                   
                5) ALl default options of SOLIDEDIT command were not 
                   set correctly.
