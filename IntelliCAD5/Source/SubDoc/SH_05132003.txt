Description:	This submission reimplemented the REGION command and made some major
                changes to the EXTRUDE and REVOLVE commands in order to fix the bug 
                #78522 - "Boolean operations not possible with region and extruded 
                entities" and following REGION, XTRUDE, and REVOLVE problems, which 
                are not reported: 
		
		1) The separated, non-overlapping regions were created by REGION 
		   command for the intersected curves(i.e. REGION incorrectly created 
		   3 separated, non overlapping regions for two intersected circles), 
		   which is wrong totally. 
		
		2) In the certain cases, the resions created had wrong normal face 
		   direction, which caused EXTRUDE and REVOLVE to create invalid solid 
		   with negative volumn or sweep face along wrong direction.
		
		3) All selected curves were deleted after the regions were created when 
		   some of them were rejected because they don't belong to any loop.
		   
		4) The selected curves were not unhighlighted when REGION, EXTRUDE, and 
		   REVOLVE commands failed.
		
		5) No error messages were given when REGION, EXTRUDE, and REVOLVE  
		   commands failed.
		
		6) Unable to create extruded solids with a taper angle.
		
		The original implemtation of REGION did not consider the input curves 
		could be either open or closed, and form some loops that may intersect 
		each other. It just simply passed all selected curves to ACIS modeler 
		to create regions, which is wrong and caused some of problems above.
		The new implemtation build the loops from the curves first and then
		test them to reject non-planar or/and self-intersected loops. The 
		manifold vertex case is also taken acocunt. The double side regions 
		are created from the loops.
