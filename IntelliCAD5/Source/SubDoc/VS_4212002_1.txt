Description:	This submission adds the source for regress_scr application.
Comments:	There are two regress applications. The first regress application runs the regress suite
		consisting of scr files. The executable (regress_scr.exe) is placed in the Regress directory.
		Under the Regress directory are the following directories :-
		
		scripts -- this directory stored the scr files to run regress. Each scr file will load lsp files and/or
			   run commands directly. The last steps in the scr file are to write out a dxf file with the same
			   prefix name as the scr file in the output_dxf directory follwed by a quit command. This way each
			   scr file will automatically exit.
		LISP -- this directory and its child directories stores LSP files which the scr files load and run.
			Since the scr files are run from the parent directory (which is Regress), scr files should do
			(load "Regress/aaa.lsp") to load aaa.lsp file.
		output_dxf -- Each scr file will write a dxf file to this directory.
		base -- The base dxf files for comparison are placed here.
		results -- The regress_scr can run Purify, Boundschecker, TrueTime and TrueCoverage builds. The output
			   files from these progra,s are placed here.
		log -- Each scr file will write a log file saved to this directory. This facility doesn't work properly.

		Required system variables :-

		ICAD_REGRESS_EXE_PATH -- This has the complete path (including icad.exe) to the icad executable.
		The following are optional --
		TT_EXE -- True Time executable
		ICAD_TT_REGRESS_EXE_PATH -- ICAD executable instrumented with TrueTime.
		BC_EXE -- Boundschecker executable.
		TC_EXE -- Truecoverage executable.
		ICAD_COV_REGRESS_EXE_PATH -- ICAD executable instrumented with TrueCoverage.
		PURIFY_EXE -- Purify executable.
		ICAD_PURIFY_EXE -- Icad executable instrumented by Purify.

		Output file :-

		icadregress.log

		
		The regress_scr.exe processes all scr files in the scripts directory. After the scr file completes, it modifies
		some of the output lines in the dxf file written out to the output_dxf directory to set variables like 
		TD_CREATE, $TDUPDATE, $TDINDWG and $TDUSRTIMER to 0.0. Then this dxf file is compared to a base dxf file and 
		differences (if any) are logged to a log file. The log file also has the time spent in running each scr file and 
		the total time spent to run regress.
