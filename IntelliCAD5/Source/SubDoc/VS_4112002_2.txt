Description:	This submission adds further scripts to the regress suite.

		The regress_scr.exe now supports running with Purify.
		If an argument (purify) is present, the appropriate application is run and the
		result files saved to the results directory. System environment variables PURIFY_EXE has to be set.

		Updated a couple of base files.

File by File:	Initial versions of the scr and dxf files shown above have been added.
		Source/regress/regress_scr.exe
			Executable to run regress has been updated to support Purify.
