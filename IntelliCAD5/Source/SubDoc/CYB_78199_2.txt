Description:	ICAD crashes if combined length of  sufix & prefix is greater than  that allowed by Dimapost
Comments:	TaL78199
Problem Analyis:
		In IntelliCAD the size of DIMPOST and DIMAPOST is limited to 16 characters. Out of these 16 characters 1 
		character will be for '\0' and 2 characters will be for delimiters ( [ ] or < > ) of DIMAPOST or DIMPOST. 
		So actaully we can have only 13 characters Prefix or Suffix.


		The function svar_StrSet() is called on every character type in the edit boxes Of DIMPOST and DIMAPOST. 
		So whenever the size of DIMPOST exceed its limit there were message boxes on screen stating so. But as this 
		function is called on evey character, when 2-3 characters we extra there were messages poping 
		continuosly. This was the problem. To fix this problem in our last fix We had taken a static variable 
		( bDialogDisplayed ) which will save the state Dialog displayed on screen.
		
Proposed Solution:
		With the help of Denis code-review we have managed to get rid of the static variable and also used svar_StrGet() 
		to get and set the edit boxes properly.

File by File:
	*	Source/prj/ICAD/IcadSetVarsDia.cpp

		When ever the length exceed 15, we send message svar_StrGet and update the edit box which is less than 15. We also 
		set the latest value to DIMPOST / DIMAPOST variable at the end.
