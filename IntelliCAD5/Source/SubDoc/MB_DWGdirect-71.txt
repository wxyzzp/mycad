Change Overview:
Changed all template opening opportunities to use .dwt files instead of .dwg

Implemented Allison's doc review suggestions including adding a help button
to the DWF export options dialog, and removing periods and semi-colons etc.
Help button responds to both pressing the button, and F1.

Also worked on some hatching issues, but am waiting on ODT for some feedback.

Notes to Developers:

Notes to QA:
Note since BASEFILE is saved in the registry, you may have to actually change
the sysvar the first time. New installs will have it set correctly upon install.
