Description:	DIM > update does not update tolerance. 
Comments:	TaL78222.
File_By_File:
	*	Source/prj/lib/CMDS/DimStyle.cpp
		On Apply, onky dimensions were updated. Now even tolerance is updated. 
		There was one more problem, the selected entities remain hilited if they were not dimensions or tolerance.
		This is also fixed now.
	*	Source/prj/lib/CMDS/Dimensions.cpp
		Tolerance entity could not be overriden by Dimoverride command. This case is fixed here
		by checking only tolerance and dimension entity.
	*	Source/prj/Icad/icadwndaction.cpp
		Tolerance entity was not been updated through DDIM command. This case is fixed 
		here by adding tolerance in the filter along with dimension.
