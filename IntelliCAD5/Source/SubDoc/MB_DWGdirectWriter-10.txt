Change Description:
Added support for round tripping Viewports, groups, and layouts.
Layouts were pretty ugly.
Groups & layouts are part of 'object' round tripping, which has
now begun. There is still alot to code for.


Notes to Developers:

Notes to QA:
Layouts are by nature confusing. While I feel I have nailed it, I
would be remiss if I didn't suggest extra attention be given to layouts
during testing.
