Change Description:
Another visit to layouts.

Added code to honor frozen layers in mview viewports, but IntelliCAD
has a bug which prevents it from working. Note round trip works via
DWGdirect. However, displaying viewports with frozen layers in XFEF
drawings isn't working. 

Notes to Developers:

Notes to QA:
I emailed bugs@IntelliCAD.org.

IntelliCAD isn't honoring frozen layers in mview viewports when
the layer belongs to an xref'd drawing.
