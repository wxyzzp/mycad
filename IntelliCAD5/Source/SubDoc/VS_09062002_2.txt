Description:	This submission adds a flexible roundtrip application.
Comments:	This submission a flexible roundtrip application. This can be customised to run any combination of
		ICAD and ACAD versions and to open/save different versions of the dwg file. The restriction is at most 5 steps
		can be performed. This application is written in Visual Basic and the executable is checked in.

		You would need roundtrip.exe and the 3 bmp files to run the application. The other files are checked in
		in case someone wants to modify the application.

		This application allows the user to perform roundtrip 
		testing of Icad and Acad. The application allows the user 
		to test from 1 to 5 steps in roundtrip. For each step, either Icad or Acad 
		can be used. In addition, a different version of the executable
		can be used at each step.

		WARNING -- the output directory should not be under the 
		directory to process

		There are two tabs in the application. In the options tab, 
		the user can specify a default location for icad.exe and acad.exe.
		The user can set the directory to process and a directory to 
		place the output files. All dwg files in the input directory are processed
		and the output files placed in the output directory. The input folder 
		is recursively processed and the same hierarchy is created for the output 
		folder.

		The output dwg file from one step in the input dwg file for the next
		step. The appliation builds a scr file on the fly for each dwg file 
		it is processing and for each step. This scr file is run against the
		executable chosen for that step.

		It is the responsibility of the user to ensure that the roundtrip steps
		are valid. For example, if step 1 is ICAD 2001 version and step 2 is ACAD R14 
		version, the saveas for step 1 should be a version ACAD R14 can recognise.
		Also the saveas from step 2 should be a format ACAD R14
		can write out to.
