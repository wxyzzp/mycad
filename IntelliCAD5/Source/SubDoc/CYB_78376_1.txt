Description:	Lwpolyline with varying widths cannot be created. This Submission is provided by Bruce Scott of Eagle Point.
Comments:	TaL78376
Problem Analysis:
		The polyines drawn previously did not take care of different width sets. No code to check if the widths are 
		same or different.
Proposed Solution:
		This solution is provide by Bruce Scott of Eagle Point. Find out if the polylines are of with different widths and depending on it set the dxf 43.
		
File by File:
	*	Source/prj/CMDS/polyline.cpp
		Starting and eding width of every segment is compared to find out if the width is constant and a ( bAllWidthsAreEqual ) variable is set
		accordingly. Depending on the bAllWidthsAreEqual, a node of DF 43 is added to list list
