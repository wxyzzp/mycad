Description:	This submission fixes the bug #73862 - Pline created by converting non-Plines 
                w/ PEDIT should create LWPOLY when PLINETYPE=2.
                
                The problems was cmd_pedit() did not check the value of PLINETYPE and just
                convert entities other than lightweight PLINE to regular PLINE before they 
                were edited. This is fixed by changing cmd_pedit() to add checks for the 
                value of PLINETYPE and convert lines, arcs, and cricles to LWPLINE when the
                value of PLINETYPE is not zero.
