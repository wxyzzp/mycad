Description:	This submission fixed polyline fillet and chamfer problem
                reported in #78470 and other polyline releated problems 
                memtioned at below, which have not been reported.
                
		1) FILLET/CHAMFER incorectly allowed the selected lines to 
		   be seaprated by more than one polyline segment.

		2) They incorrectly filleted and chamfered all vertices 
		   between selected edges.

		3) For the case the lines are separated by one polyline segment, 
		   they didn't replace the segment with fillet a chamfer line 
		   or fillet.

		4) For the closed polylines, which vertex would be chamfered 
		   or filleted was incorrectly depending on the selected order.
