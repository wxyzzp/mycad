Description:	This submission fixes an infinite loop in the display code and merges one change from R40_dev to R40_from_11.
Comments:	In this submission the following change from R40_Dev is merged into R40_from_11. Also fixed an infinite loop
		in gr_clip_vector().

		In gr_clip_vector() the input is a clip rectangle and 4 values represnting the 2 end points of the line
		to be clipped. It is possible that the data for a line segment being clipped could have invalid values (QNAN).
		An example of how this can be generated is when user creates a line, and invokes F8 when a point is
		requested. The presence of a NAN makes the gr_clip_vector() go into an infinite loop. The fix was to have a
		counter which keeps track of the number of times the input line segment is clipped against the window. If the
		counter reaches 5, the loop exits and returns 1 (to signify the line was outside the clip rectangle). In the normal
		case, we can clip a line max. of 4 times against the clip rectange.
