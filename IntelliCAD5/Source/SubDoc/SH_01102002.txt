DESCRIPTIONS:	
 
 	This submission adds the fillet and chamfer for ACIS solids.
 	

COMMANDS:

        The fillet and chamfer commands for solids allow users to chamfer and fillet the edges
        of ACIS solids. They have the same command syntax and functionality as ones in AutoCAD 
        R14. The commands are only available if IntelliCAD is built with ACIS DLLs.
	

CHANGED FILES:	

	CvsHist:Source/Prj/Lib/DB/DbAcisEntity.h:  Added CDbAcisEntityData& getData() to 
						   the CDbAcisEntity class.
		
	CvsHist:Source/Prj/Lib/DB/Modeler.h:
	CvsHist:Source/Prj/Lib/DB/ModelerStub.h:
	CvsHist:Source/Prj/Lib/ACIS/AsModeler.h:
	CvsHist:Source/Prj/Lib/ACIS/AsModeler.cpp: Added createEdgeChamfer(), createEdgeFillet(),
		                                   getSmoothConnnectedEdges(), getAdjacentFaces(),
		                                   getEdgesOfFace(), getEdgeLoop(), isEdgeOnFace()
		                                   to those classes.
		
	CvsHist:Source/Prj/Lib/CMDS/cmds4.cpp:     Added getSystemInfo(), updateDisplayOfSolidEdges(),
						   setChamferDistance(), setFilletRadius(), and 
						   added code to cmd_fillet() and cmd_chamfer() to 
						   fillet and chamfer solid edges.
						   
	CvsHist:Source/Prj/ICAD/ICADApp.cpp:       Modified CIcadApp::~CIcadApp() to call 
	                                           CModeler::stop().	   
	
	CvsHist:Source/Prj/ICAD/res/Icadrc2.h:     Added resource ID for strings.
	
	
	
	CvsHist:Eng-us/icad.rc2:                   Added strings to string table.


		
KNOWN PROBLEMS:  As other commands for solids, the UNDO and REDO also don't work for fillet and 
                 chamfer for solids. This issue will be addressed later because it requires to 
                 make some changes to the architecture for solids.
