Change Description:
Wblock was broken, as in no output file was being created.
I changed a test looking for RTNORM from a function that never returns RTNORM in clonehelper.

Also, change a test in cmdswblock that was deleting the entities being
wblocked from the ORIGINAL drawing if there was any kind of problem during
wblock. I changed the test value, but left the (what looks like) orginal
code in place and added an ASSERT() to fire if we ever drop into what I
believe to be bogus code.
