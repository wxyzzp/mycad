Change Description:
I have added what I believe to be a fix for the handle problem
I have been experiencing. It basically lets me set the handseed
in the ouput drawing prior to populating it. That way and hidden
objects that DWGdirect creates should be outside the handle range
of any objects I'm about to put into the empty output file.
