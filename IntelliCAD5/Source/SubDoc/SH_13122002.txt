DESCRIPTIONS:	
 
 	This submission fixed a bug introduced by one of my previous submission.
 	In that submission, I changed sds_pmtssget() to only add the entities 
 	specified in the filte in the grip selection to the new selection to fix
 	a bug. But unfortunately since I did really understand the behavious of
 	sds_ssadd() function, the entities added to the new selection were freed 
 	after the grip selection was freed. This bug is fixed.
 	

CHANGED FILES:	

	Source/Prj/Lib/sds/sds_selectset.cpp:  Changed sds_pmtssget().
