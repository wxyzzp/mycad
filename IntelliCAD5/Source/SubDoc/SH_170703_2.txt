Description:	This submission fixes the bug #76566 - Second similar BHatch seed point pick 
                will cause boundary hatch to not display although still listed in the 
                database..
                
                The problem was that the BHATCH command did not check if the same area had 
                been picked already so when the area was picked again, it would use the 
                same boundary to hatch the area again and caused the problem.
                
                If the same procedure is performed in AutoCAD the second pick produces a 
                warning message dialog stating "Boundary produces a duplicate boundary" and 
                the user must press OK to continue.  AutoCAD will then continue on in the 
                command, accept the first pick, and apply the boundary hatch. 
                
                This problem is fixed by adding a check to verify whether the boundary is 
                on the candidate list already after users pick hatch area. If so, we don't 
                add it to the list again and will error out.
