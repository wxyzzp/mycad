		Implementation of routines for PaperOrientation, PaperSize and Hidelines.		
		No problem for implementing PaperOrientation. The value is set properly and effect is also seen.
		There is no method exported for PaperSize in AutoCAD. But IntelliCAD has and so we are implementing it. Unless one 			change the papersize ( A4, A5 etc ) the preview does not change. By changing the length and width of paper does not have 			the effect on preview. 
		Hideline effect is not implemented in IntelliCAD. There is no way we can set it through print dialog. The Hideline method is 			exported. We have just implemented it but there will be no effect in preview.
