Description:	This submission made following changes:

                1) Implemented BREAK command for spline.
                
                2) Implemented new NURBS functionality to GEO 
                   library to normalize, reparameterize, and 
                   manipulate NURBS and knot vector.
                   
                3) Fixed the bug in SPLINE command that set 
                   rational as non-rational.
                   
                4) Fixed the problems in the NURBS functions 
                   in GEO library.
                
Comments        None.
