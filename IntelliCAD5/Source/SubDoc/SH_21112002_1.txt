Description:	This submission fixes bug #78360 - Full ACIS-ICAD crashes at 
                chamfer command prompt

Comments:	The code did not check if the face had been selected before it
                moved to next step to call modeler function to create a chamfer,
                which caused a BAD pointer to be passed into ACIS API function.
                The bug is fixed.
