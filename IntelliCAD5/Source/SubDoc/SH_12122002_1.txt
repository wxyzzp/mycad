Description: This submission fixes following bugs.
             

             BUG #78118: ICAD crashes for different selection options at the 
                         "Chamfer" command

             RESOLUTION: IntelliCAD crashes because the test case uses a 
                         invalid option to select so an invalid handle
                         is passed into cmd_chamfer() function. The function
                         didn't verify the handle and tried to access the 
                         data the handle pointing to, which caused IntelliCAD
                         to crash. This is fixed.
                         
                         
             BUG #78191: ICAD crashes on using Backspace after start of script 
                         recording

             RESOLUTION: The code moves the file pointer back one byte after 
                         the backspace is used. But it didn't verify if the 
                         pointer at begin position of the file first so 
                         IntelliCAD crashed in this case when the file pointer 
                         was at the begin of the file. This is fixed.
                         
                         
             BUG #78018: ICAD crashes if RTROT command is used after UCS is 
                         rotated and a circle is drawn.

             RESOLUTION: The value of VIEWCTR was incorrect after the UCS was
                         rotated about an AXIS 90 degree, which casued ICAD 
                         crashing at RTROT command when the code tried to 
                         draw the image of UCSICON outside boundary of 
                         the image bitmap while the mouse was moving. The reason
                         VIEWCTR was incorrect becuase the epsilon was not taken
                         account when it compares a component value of view 
                         direction vector with 0.0. This is fixed.
