Change Description:
Added code to round trip wipeout entities.
Note this is a partial fix. DWG is fine.
However, exporting to DXF doesn't not display the
wipeout boundary. The wipeout exists and is correct
in every other way. This is related to my ability
to get the binary data associated with the wipeout.
I have been working with the ODT folks to get this 
resolved.

Notes to Developers:

Notes to QA:
I would hold off testing wipeout export to DXF until
I can get my issue addressed by the ODT guys.
