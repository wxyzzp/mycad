Description:	After gripping a LEADER, the start point is not asked by LEADER command. This was a sideeffect of 
		previous check-in from 4m Item 27. This Submission is also provided by Mina Polemi of 4m. 
Comments:	TaL78005
Problem Analysis:
		Due to fix of item 27 of 4M, the last point was used by leader command after grip editing the leader. 
		The culprit was the variable "GripRClickedFlag"
Proposed Solution:
		The proposed solution is by Mina Polemi of 4M. Currently "GripRClickedFlag" fixes this problem of leader 
		but the original fix of 4M item 27 does not work. But as this is basic fucntionality which is expected to work
		this submisssion is accepted and sometime later the fix of item 27 of 4m can be fixed.
