DESCRIPTIONS:	
 
 	This submission fix the bug# 78353.
 	

COMMANDS:

        This problem is introduced after I made changes to comment out _USE_OPENGL_ in OnPaint()
        in order to force the hidden line image to be redrawed whenever screen side is changed,
        which caused the screen to be re-painted every time whenever dragging was active. 
        To fix the problem, instead of repainting hidden line image, I change the HIDE functions
        to copy the screen DC to off-screen windows' DC after using OpenGL to generate hidden 
        line image.
	

CHANGED FILES:	

	Source/Prj/Iacad/IacadView.cpp:  	Changed OnPaint() to remove comment on _USE_OPENGL_. 
		
	Source/Prj/Lib/cmd/HideAndShade.cpp:    Modifed CGLPaintHiddenLineImage::RenderSense() to 
	                                        blit from on screen DC to off-screen.
