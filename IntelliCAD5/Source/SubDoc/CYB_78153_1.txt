		The #defines for X_ORDINATE and Y_ORDINATE were wrong
		changed them according to AutoCAD's help (DXF REFERENCE) 
		//BugZilla No. 78153; 20-05-2002
		//#define DIM_x_ORDINATE    6
		//#define DIM_Y_ORDINATE    70
		#define DIM_Y_ORDINATE    6
		#define DIM_x_ORDINATE    70


		* CvsHist:Source/prj/lib/CMDS/DimContinue.cpp       
		Complete implementation of drawing a continous ordinate dimension
		to a previous ordinate dimension.
		
		Case statements were not being executed properly. 
		Logic was written for the complete manipulation of points based on 
		the previous dimension
		
		Calculation of the proper dimtext

		The build list was not done with some parameters missing and 
		some parameters not passed with correct values.

		plink->DefValidflg had to set so that the newly created dimension 
		is of the same type (X / Y) as the previous one.
