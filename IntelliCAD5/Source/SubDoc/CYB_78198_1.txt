Description:	Explode of Ordinate dimension with Dimtad=1 has extra line.
Comments:	TaL78198.

		* Source/prj/lib/CMDS/DimOrdinate.cpp
		
		When UCS is not same as WCS, and when co-ordinates of pt13 and pt14
		are entered parallel to any co-ordinate axes ( X / Y ) sometimes a ordinate 
		dimension is drawn which has 3 lines in its dim block, where as it should have 
		only 1 ( compare with ACAD ). This was a FUZZ problem solved with using 
		cmd_real_equal instead of "=".   
		
		When dimtad was ON, there was an extra call to cmd_dimaddline
		this logic was for adding the hookline under the text.
		Now changed this code so that only the correct no of cmd_dimaddline
		calls are made, depending on the condition. The end-point of the line
		had been previously calculated, so the same point is being used for 
		adding the line.      

		This fix will now solve 2 problems 
		a ) After explode there will be correct no of entries ( same as ACAD )
		b ) Fly-over snaps will show end-points correctly, as the entity database 
		will be correct now.
