Change Description:
Changes made to fix a couple of regression script failures.
Fixes 77860.scr, 78393.scr, Spline.scr.

utilities.cpp - added three missing group code numbers in ReadWriteUtils::getOdResBufPtrFromSdsResBufPtr().
giworlddrawvectors.cpp - Filled in a bit more of the vector retrieval function OdGiEntityGeometry::mesh().
dwgdirectreader.cpp - Changed the function making sortents to actually make the entity. This was causeing a
					  script to crash upon dwg cleanup/distruction. Sortents is still not fully implemented,
					  I have information requests in to the ODT guys on this issue. Also removed a call to
					  set a given CDbPlotSettings's name member, because it was stepping on the name that was
					  alread correct and in the dictionary record for it.
dwgdirectconverter.cpp - Added an argument to let the vertex creation function know which type of vertex to create.
					  I could not rely on the 70 group code for the information because there can be 8 and 16 group
					  code vertices for both 2D and 3D vertices.

Code reformatting only no code change on the following files;
drawing.cpp
