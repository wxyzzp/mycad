DESCRIPTIONS:	
 
 	This submission fixed the following bugs that appeared in Win32 Release build
 	only.
 	
 	     BUG #78353 - "With Full ACIS support entities are not seen as soon as 
 	                  they are created". 
 	         
 	     BUG #78354 - "With Full ACIS support builds, zoom>extents zooms out too 
 	                   much".
 	

COMMANDS:

        The solids were actually created but could not be displayed because some values of the
        coordinates of the display objects were infinite big.
        
	The problem was the data members of the icl::point class was not initialized in 
	the default constructor, which caused the values of m_draggingStart and m_draggingCurr 
	of the gr_acisGetDispObjs class were used without initialized in Win32 Release build. 
	Since the values of m_draggingStart and m_draggingCurr were invalid, an invalid 
	translation vector was created and applied to the display objects, which made
	the display objects of the solids become infinite. 
	

CHANGED FILES:	

	Source/Prj/Lib/IACADLIB/gvector.inl:       Changed to initialize the coordinates in 
	                                           point::point() and gvector::gvector();
	                                           
	Source/Prj/Lib/IACADLIB/matrix.h:          Changed to set matrix to identity in default
	                                           constructor.
		
	Source/Prj/Lib/ACIS/AsDisplayObject.h:
	Source/Prj/Lib/ACIS/AsDisplayObject.cpp:   Added code to write AsDisplayObject data to 
	                                           an output stream.
	                                           
	Source/Prj/Lib/ACIS/AsTools.cpp:
	Source/Prj/Lib/ACIS/AsViewer.cpp:          Changed the order of the included headers.
	
	Source/Prj/Lib/GR/DoDef.h:
	Source/Prj/Lib/GR/DoDef.cpp:               Added code to write display object lists
	                                           to an output stream.
