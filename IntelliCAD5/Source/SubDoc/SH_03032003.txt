DESCRIPTIONS:	
 
 	This submission made following changes to the code to fix problems:
 	
        1) Added 3D solids/bodeis support to SOLIDEDIT/Imprint to imprint the 
           intersection graph of 3D solids and bodies onto the solids/bodeis.
                
        2) Offsetting a face that was created by imprinting a circle on a 3D solid
           crashed IntelliCAD. The problem is ACIS' api_offset_faces() creates
           an invalid body in the case but doesn't return any error. This problem 
           was fixed by adding a call to api_check_entity() to verify the body after 
           calling api_offset_faces().
           
        3) Unable to change the color of faces of 3D solids. The problem was that 
           we attached the color attribute to the face entity only but not edges.
           This bug was fixed by attaching the color to the edges of the face also.
        
        4) Changed to cmd_extrude() and cmd_revolve() to delete temporary curves 
           created by geodata::extract() to create regions.
           
        5) Modified cmd_subtract() to fix display problem.
        
        6) Modified CCmdQueryEntity::query() to ask users to select an entity
           again if the picked point was not on any entity. Originally the
           function was implemented to throw an exception if the users clicked a 
           point that was not on the wireframe of any entity, which caused the command
           to be terminated. Also modified this function to highlight the selected
           entity.
           
	7) Fixed SOLIDEDIT that was not able to change face color.
	
	8) Modified SOLIDEDIT to prevent terminating the command in the case when 
	   the modeler failed to performance local operation. 
	   
	9) The face editing subcommands, Extrude and Offset in SOLIDEDIT did remove
	   selected face form the screen. Those problems have been fixed.
