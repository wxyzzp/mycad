Change Description:
Fixed the problem that prevented script 78037 from running
to completion under DWGdirect.
Instead of setting the text string in linetype dashes to NULL
when the string was empty, I was setting it to the address of the
string. I have added code to test for and empty string and set
the value to NULL instead of the address of the empty string.
