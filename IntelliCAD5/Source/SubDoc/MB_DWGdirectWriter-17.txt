Change Description:
Moved some static member functions into their own
class so more than one other class could take advantage of them.

Fixed a bug having to do with the int type of a resbuf being read
for a group 90 value. It should have been looking at the rlong value
instead.

Fixed a linetype and line weight issue.

Also reworked the conversion throat for export to match the sequence
that the reader takes. This helps with nested block conversion.
