Change Description:
I ran into a little problem with groups when the group is on
a 'other that model' layout. When not on the model layout, the 
group resides in the *Paper_Space1, or *Paper_Space2 etc block.
I can't make the groups until the entities in these blocks have 
been created. So I move the group dictionary processing into a
stand alone function that gets called from the end of 
TransferBlocksToDWGdirect() instead of having the groups be processed
in TransferObjectsToDWGdirect() which is done prior to block entities
being converted.

In addition, I'm submitting the file MB_DWGdirectWriter-10.txt which
I forgot to submit with that submission.
