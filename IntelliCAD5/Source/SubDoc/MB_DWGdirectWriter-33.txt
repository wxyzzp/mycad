Project IntelliCAD development


Document Title		MB_DWGdirectWriter-33.txt
Produce Version		ICAD 4

Engineer(s):		Mark Barrow


Change Description:
This submission is for preparing for the new ODT DWGdirect libraries.
I have added a few member variables for maintaining proxy class and
proxy data information.
Note that proxy objects and proxy entities are still not ready for
export. The new ODT libraries are specifically to handle that.

Notes to Developers:
Note that the new ODT libs now have a class to handle the new
(2005) table entity. IntelliCAD's database will need to be updated
to handle this new entity.

In addition, I believe I may have submitted my configure.h file which
has BUILD_WITH_LICENSED_COMPONENTS defined. I am re-submitting it with
this #define commented out.
