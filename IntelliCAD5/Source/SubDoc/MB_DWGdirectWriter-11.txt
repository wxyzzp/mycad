Project IntelliCAD development


Document Title		MB_DWGdirectWriter-11.txt
Produce Version		ICAD 4

Change Description:
Added support for round tripping Mline Styles, Mlines and splined
heavy weight 2dPolylines.
Also added some code to cmdsdraworder to test for a null db_drawing
pointer. I was crashing on it when attempting to open a drawing when
IntelliCAD's default drawing was not open. I.E launch icad, close the
current drawing, then open a new one. This check prevents using the
NULL pointer.
