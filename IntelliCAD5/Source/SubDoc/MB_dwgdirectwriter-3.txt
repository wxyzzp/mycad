Change Description:
Added stubs for several export functions.
Added code to export;
	Dimstyles
	System Variables (partially done - there are a lot of them)
Added a few helper functions to help get OdDb ids from IntelliCAD 'name' strings.

Also added a db_handitem* to db_viewtabrec for round tripping associated UCS information.
It is not being used anywhere but in the DWGdirect export code.
Note, I have emails in to the ODT guys on the failure of the function OdDbAbstractViewTableRecord::setUcs()
to attach the UCS properly in the exported drawing. Am following up.
