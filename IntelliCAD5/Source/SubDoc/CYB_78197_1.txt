		Dimtad, Dimgap and Dimtxt were not being considered properly when 
		drawing a ordinate dimension. Their combinations as mentioned in 
		Bugzilla were giving various problems. 

		The textbox points were being wrongly calculated.
		The calculation of the BOX when dimgap < 0 has now been seperated and 
		moved into a if condition. The duplicate end point calculation has been
		removed and the point is calculated at a single location which is used for
		adding the dim lines and also calculating the BOX when dimgap < 0.

		The line ( below dim txt ) was extending beyond the text when dimtad is 
		ON this has been corrected and is now similar to ACAD

		The gap between text and dimension line was calculated on a hard coded
		factor which was wrong, now the calcualtion is based on DIMGAP and DIMSCALE
		and is comaptible with ACAD      

		* Source/prj/lib/CMDS/dimensions.h
		The prototype of GetUpperDimgap(); has been added, the function is defined 
		in file DimDiaRad.cpp
