		In buildlist of dimension we have used dimtxt variable. The problem here is that 			dimtxt variable have the default value of dimension text. Now when 					the user press enter while DDIM > angular for text prompt, this plink->text is 				not updated hence the varaible DIMTXT. So dimtxt value is considered as if 		entered by user and stored in dxf 1 of entity and not updated when the user drags 		the dimension. There was no such problem for dimlinear dimension. The code here 		does not check for ( *fs1 ) after user enters the value.
	*	Source/prj/lib/CMDS/DimContinue.cpp
		Similar problem as mentioned above. Our aim here is to copy whatever entered by 			user to dimtxt and hence in plink->text. If user press enter ie blank string no 			problem.. copy it to dimtxt and hence to plink->text. 
	*	Source/prj/lib/CMDS/DimOrdinate.cpp
		Similar fix for problem mentioned above in this file also.
