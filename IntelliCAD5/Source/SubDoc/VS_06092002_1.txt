Description:	Performance improvement in load of groups.
Comments:	This submission improves performance of groups in large drawings by a substantial factor. The fix is not to call 
		CDbGroup::addEntity() for each entity in a group in drw_readwrite::drw_marcompopen(). Instead, the linked list is
		maintained and CDbGroup::setEntitiesList() is called. In one large 12MB dwg file, open time came down to 25 sec. from 11 minutes.

		Fixed memory leak in HandleTable class. Added a destructor and cleared the map.
