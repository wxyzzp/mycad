		This is a modification of the previous fix, where the entities
		in blocks would not snap after opening explorer.While 
		working with the code previously it was found that gr_selected
		woule not return the correct selected entity, even though the entity was
		selected properly. It was found that the entity extents were wrong. 
		It was fixed at that time by recalculating the entity extents every time an 
		entity was selected.
 
			The fix now has been modified to the location where the extents
		were being wrongly set. The code for creating a bitmap ( required to be 
		displayed in explorer ) actually modifed the entity extents. The previous fix
		has now been completely undone.

		SDS_UpdateEntDisp(ename,FstPt ? 5 : 1,pView->m_pCurDwgView);
		The flags which used to set the extents have been removed.
