Notes to Developers:

Notes to QA:
I have also submitted \source\regress\lisp\dwgdirectonoff.lsp. This file
has notes in it on its use. Basically it lets you switch between the DWGdirect
reader/writer and the older OpenDWG open/save code paths. 
The notes explains how to use a OS system variable to make DWGdirect the default
read/write code path.
