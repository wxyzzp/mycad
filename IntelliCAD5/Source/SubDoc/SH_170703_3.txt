Description:	This submission fixes the bug #77848 - When create a circle tangent two 
                other circles using RTT option, it can only create 2 of the possible circles.
                
                The original implementation of CIRCLE/RTT is very limited and only works in 
                the case when the candidate circle is located below or above two non-intersected 
                separated( one is not inside another one)circles. That is, it only addresses 2 
                of 10 possible cases in a circle tangent two circles problem. It also incorrectly 
                used the distance between the center of candidate circle and the pick point on
                circles rather than the tangent point to the pick point distance as the 
                criteria to identity the candidate tangent points to solve a circle tangent 
                two circles and a circle another circle and a line problems, which is wrong.
                All the problems have been fixed by this submission.
