Description:	continue/baseline  dimensions to  Angular dimension are not 
		drawn correctly.

		For dim type DIM_ANGULAR continous dimension was not being drawn 
		from the side closest(original dimension) to the point user selected, added 
		code now to draw it from the closest direction of the user point selection.

		For dim type DIM_ANGULAR_3P code was written to check for 
		closest side to the point user selected in all cases, this is required only 
		in case of continous dimsension and not baseline, baseline dimsnion should 
		be always drawn from pt13. 
		Hence  added an if else statement to seperate the baseline and contionus 
		flows, also the code used a wrong centre to calculate angles, used the 
		correct one now.
		
		ICAD was prompting for text in all both angular dimension types, Now it 
		does not propmt for dimtext (same as ACAD)

		Since the dimtxt is not changed from the dimcontinue/baseline but is 
		calculated when the dimension is being created, removed the plink->dimtxt
		from the sds_buildlist call.
