Description:	ICAD should not allow creation of leader having different z-coordinates for each point.
Comments:		TaL78476
Problem Analysis:
		The z-coordinate of all the definition points of the leader was set based on the user entry and thus the leader was drawn across different planes which was wrong. The bug is also reproducible through VBA and SDS.  
Proposed Solution:	
		The z-coordinate of all the definition points of the leader should be set equal to the z-coordinate of the first definition point (in the DrawLeader() as well as through VBA and SDS).  	
File by File:	
*		Source/prj/lib/CMDS/Leader.cpp?rev=1.7.6.4 
		Captured the z-coordinate of the first definition point and set the z-coordinate of all the definition points equal to it.	
*		Source/prj/lib/DB/drawing.cpp?rev=1.25.4.14 
		Traversed the entire elist of leader, captured the z-coordinate of the first definition point and set the z-coordinate of all the definition points equal to it. 
*		Source/prj/lib/AUTO/AutoLeader.cpp?rev=1.3.12.1 
		Captured the z-coordinate of the first definition point and set the z-coordinate of all the vertices equal to it.
*		Source/prj/lib/AUTO/AutoEntities.cpp?rev=1.7.6.2 
		Set the z-coordinate of all the definition points equal to that of the first definition point. Also set the insertion point's z-coordinate.
