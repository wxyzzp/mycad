Description:	Size of inserted object changes after inplace editing.

		The actaul problem in this bug was that VIEWSIZE variable is recalculated on 				
		returning back to IntelliCAD after completeing the ole inplace editing. After 				
		returning to IntelliCAD's view, OnSize() function is called. In this function 				
		VIEWSIZE is calculated and set which changes the size of view. 						
		cmd_InsideViewPorts,cmd_InsideOpenCommand are used to avoid recaculation of 				
		VIEWSIZE, but we just cannot know that this time OnSize is called after 				
		ole-editing. To know this we have taken a variable m_bLastInPlaceActiveItem which 		
		is initialised to false in contructor. The variable is set to true using 				
		GetInPlaceActiveItem(SDS_CURVIEW) and again set to false inside the if condition.
