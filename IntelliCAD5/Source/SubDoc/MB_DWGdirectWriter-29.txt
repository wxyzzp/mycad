Change Description:
Added code to allow export as 2004 from scripts.

NOTE:
	Currently it is only when 'filedia' is of - i.e. NOT using the 
	file save dialog box.

	This is to make scripting able to saveas or dxfout as 2004 for 
	testing.

I'm waiting for the right time to do the same for saving via the
file save dialog. It's pretty ugly in there and I want to rework
it because 2005 isn't that far behind, and I'd like to make it 
easier to add 2005 when it comes.

Notes to Developers:
Note; NO changes were made to sds_get.cpp. I simply reformated
SDS_GetFiled() so I could get a better understanding of what it 
was doing.


Notes to QA:
With 'filedia' off, drawings can be scripted to saveas or dxfout
as 2004 versions.
