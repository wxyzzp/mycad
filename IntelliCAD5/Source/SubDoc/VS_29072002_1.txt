Description:	Regress script application can run Autocad executable.
Comments:	To benchmark scripts in Icad and Acad, the regress script application can run Acad as well. If the exe chosen is
		not icad.exe (ie) the last 8 characters of the exe name is not "icad.exe", acad is run.

		At this point, I am converting the regress scripts to run under Acad R14. This will form the basis for seeing
		how slow Icad is withrespect to Acad.


File by File:	
		Source/Regress_apps/regress Script Application/reg.exe 		Rev 1.4
			Updated version of the Exe.
		Source/Regress_apps/regress Script Application/reg.frm		Rev 1.4
			If exe is not "icad.exe", a "/b " is added to the command syntax to allow it run under Acad.
