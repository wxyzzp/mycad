Description:	This submission updates the regress applications.
Comments:	This submission adds new functionality to the regress applications. regress_scr.exe automatically
		runs all scr files in a sub-directory called scripts and places its output in output_dxf, log and results
		sub-directories. Now it can take an optional parameter which is the sub-directory where the scripts are present
		The only restriction is this sub-directory cannot be called mem, time, cov or purify. The logfile will now
		have the directory from which the scripts are run as part of its name.

		regress_scr -- runs all scr files in scripts directory. Log file is icadregress_scripts.log
		regress_scr scripts_qa -- runs all scr files in scripts_qa directory. Log file is icadregress_scripts_qa.log

		Some of the scr files which take long to run are moved to scripts_qa directory in regress.


		I have updated regress_acad_icad_roundtrip.exe to run with AutoCAD 2002. The syntax change is for the saveas
		format and it now saves as 2000 (as opposed to A2K in the old code.)

		I have checked in the actual exe files as well.
