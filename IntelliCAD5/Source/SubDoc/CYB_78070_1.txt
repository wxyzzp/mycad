Description: 	All dimension styles can be deleted.
		a) Should delete and rename STANDARD dimstyle. 
		b) Should not show xrefed dimstyle in delete combo box of delete dialog box of 		DDIM command.
		c) Should  update the DIMSTYLE combo box after deletion of dimension style.
		d) Should be able to RENAME a dimension style to name of deleted dimension style.	
		e) Should use CMD_XREF_TBLDIVIDER instead of '|'/*DNT*/  in code.

File By File :
	*	CvsHist:Source/prj/ICAD/IcadExplorer.cpp
		Commented the code in IntelliCAD which did'nt allow to delete the first table record of dimension style. The first table record can not always be standard so this as a bug. 		AutoCAD allows to delete the standard dimension style.
	*	CvsHist:Source/prj/ICAD/IcadSetVarsDia.cpp
		1. In many places Intellicad had '|'/*DNT*/ when we already have a #define 				CMD_XREF_TBLDIVIDER.
		2. Previous to this fix, xrefed style were displayed in delete dialog box but not 		allowed to delete. Now we are stopping xref style to be shown in delete dialog 				box.
		3. Previous to this fix, one could not rename a style which was just deleted as
		SDS_tblmesser(rb,IC_TBLMESSER_RENAME,SDS_CURDWG); code was used where the last 				parameter which is default parameter is false which says that check in deleted 				records also. So when we used to rename to a style just deleted we were not 				allowed as it was considering it a duplicate name. Passing last parameter to true 
		solves the problem which states search in not deleted records.
		4. Commented code which would pop message saying that  we cannot delete standard 			style.
		5. Previous to this fix, the combo box was not updating on deleting a dimension 			style. We just have to clear all the dimension style and refill them as done in 			other cases in same file.
		
	*	CvsHist:Source/prj/lib/DB/drawing.cpp
		Comment preventing deleting of standard dimension style. As we have now decided 			to be compatible with AutoCAD in this case also.
