Description: DIMJUST loses value on Dimtedit. 
Comments: TaL78238.
 
File by File:  * Source/prj/lib/CMDS/DimTEdit.cpp
  setvar calls were being made in each of the options left,right and 
  home to set DIMJUST to the values representing the above metioned
  dim text positions. The function while returning would again reset 
  DIMJUST to 0 ( hard coded ).
 
  This code seems to be carried forward even after an implemenatation 
  change of now doing an "entmod" instead of "entmake" ( previously )
  
  As now the dimjust value is stored in the EED of a dimesnion, there is
  no need to change the value of the Dimstyle variable DIMJUST in this
  function. For the same reason's the code which resets the value of 
  DIMJUST to 0 ( and not to a cached previous value ) is also removed.
