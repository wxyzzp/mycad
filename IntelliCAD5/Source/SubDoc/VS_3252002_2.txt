Description:	This submission adds dimension scripts to the IntelliCAD regress suite.
Comments:	The regress suite has been updated. The dimension scripts created by Cybage have
		been modified to fit the regress criteria and added to the regress suite.

		The regress_scr.exe now supports running with TrueTime, TrueCoverage and BoundsChecker.
		If an argument (time, mem or cov) is present, the appropriate application is run and the
		result files saved to the results directory. System environment variables TT_EXE, 
		ICAD_TT_REGRESS_EXE_PATH, BC_EXE, TC_EXE and ICAD_COV_REGRESS_EXE_PATH have to be set.
