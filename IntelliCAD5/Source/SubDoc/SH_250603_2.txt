Description:	This submission fixes the bug #78487 - Region uniting with 
                a solid results in a region rather than a body. The problem 
                is the UNION operation modifies the first entity to replace 
                its ACIS data with the data of the resulting model and destroys
                the second one. Although this behaves the same as UNION operation 
                in AutoCAD, it causes the problem above when the first selected 
                entity is a region and the second selected is a solid.The problem 
                is fixed by modifying cmd_union() to create a new body entity for 
                the resultant solid if two entities are different types.
