Description:	This submission makes the following changes to fix all known problems
                of the solidedit command:

                1) The TCmdQuerySubents, CCmdQueryFaces, and CCmdQueryEdges classes
                   were implemented to ask users to select ACIS solids first before
                   they select FACE and EDGE sub-entities. This behaviors is 
                   inconsistent with AutoCAD, which doesn't require the users to 
                   select the solids before select the sub-entities. This 
                   submission changes the implementation to be consistent with 
                   AutoCAD.
                   
                2) Changed the CAsModeler::pickFace() to do ray and body bounding
                   box test and add checks to eliminate the back planar faces before 
                   perform ray-face tests to improve the performance of face selection.
                   
                3) Changed TCmdQuerySubents and CCmdQueryFaces classes to select
                   all adjacent faces when users pick an edge. 
                   
               	4) Changed TCmdQuerySubents class to unhighlight selected edges or 
               	   faces when user cancel selection.
               	   
               	5) Changed the query() of TCmdQuerySubents class to prevent users
               	   to select the sub entities on different solids.

Comments        None.
