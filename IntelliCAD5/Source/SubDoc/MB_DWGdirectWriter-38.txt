Change Description:
This addresses some regression problems reported to me by 
Yamuna. Basically, I sprinkled some try/catch clauses around
to try and prevent crashes.

It doesn't elminate them all. I believe the remaining to be
related to the BETA libraries from ODT. It actually runs
better if I build the libs myself. However, I don't want
to submit my built ODT libs to the repository.
