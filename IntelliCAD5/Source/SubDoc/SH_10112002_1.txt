DESCRIPTIONS:	
 
 	This submission fix the bug# 78353.
 	

COMMANDS:

        This problem is introduced after I made changes to OnPaint()
	to comment out _USE_OPENGL_ in order to force the hidden line image 
	to be redrawed whenever screen size is changed/hidden. But the 
	change caused the screen to be re-painted every time when the image was
	wireframe, which confused display engine when it drawed dragging 
	objects. To fix the problem, instead of redraw hidden line image, 
	I change the HIDE/SHADE functions to copy the screen DC to off-screen 
	windows' DC after using OpenGL to generate hidden line image.

	

CHANGED FILES:	

	Source/Prj/Iacad/IacadView.cpp:  	Changed OnPaint() to remove comment on _USE_OPENGL_. 
		
	Source/Prj/Lib/cmd/HideAndShade.cpp:    Modifed CGLPaintHiddenLineImage::RenderSense() to 
	                                        blit from on screen DC to off-screen.
