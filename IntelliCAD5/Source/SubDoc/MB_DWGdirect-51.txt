Project IntelliCAD development


Document Title		MB_DWGdirect-51.txt
Produce Version		ICAD 4
Date:				06/16/2004 07:04am
Engineer(s):		Mark Barrow


Change Description:
					Removed some unused vars
					Fixed error in view center harvesting.
					Fixed some sysvars that were not being imported/exported correctly.

Notes to Developers:

Notes to QA:
					I added three utility functions that come with the DWGdirect libraries.
					These will be indispensible for testing. For example, odamfcapp.exe is
					great for opening the original (acad created) file, and the file that
					icad creates by saving the acad file and comparing the two. You'll see
					when you first launch it. The other two have their uses too, and are
					very intuitive.
