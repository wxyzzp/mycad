Description:	New regress application.
Comments:	This submission adds a new regress application to run regress scripts. This is a GUI version
		of regress_scr.exe. The user can now choose the ICAD executable to run regress with as well as the
		location of the directory where the scripts are present. 

		This executable has a timer to kill ICAD if it takes more than 5 minutes to run. To change this intreval,
		go to Option->Set to change the intreval. The fact that the scr was killed is logged to the log file.

		This application logs the kernel and user time spent in running the script as well as memory used by the
		application.
