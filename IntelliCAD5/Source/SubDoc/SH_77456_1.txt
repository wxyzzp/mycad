Description:	This submission fixes the bug #77456 - Attached drawing cannot be Xrefed or 
                Inserted in non-ACIS builds.
                
                The problem was in gr_getdispobjs(), which tried to get the display objects 
                of ACIS entities from the modeler in non-ACIS builds so it failed that caused 
                INSERT and XREF not to function correctly. The code should not be in non-ACIS
                builds. The problem is fixed by using "#ifdef BUILD_WITH_ACIS_SUPPORT" to 
                enclose the part of the code.
