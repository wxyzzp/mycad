Change Description:
Had to revisit layout export. I had a problem with block
*Paper_Space having the correct layout at save time.

Minor fix for ellipses.
Moved some collection class I need into a seperate header file.
Added code to delay conversion of dimensions and leaders until
the block they are based on has been converted (import).
